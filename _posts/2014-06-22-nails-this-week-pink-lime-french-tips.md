Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How is everyone doing today? I hope you’re having a lovely weekend so far!

So what have you been up to this week? I’ve been job-hunting (interviewing and applying, hurrah! *laughs*), and there’s no traction so far but that’s okay. I know everything will work out when it does :) I also want to use the time to continue writing the sequel to Death Wish – I’m a little over halfway through the first draft. Still a TON to do, but I’m getting there!

As you can see, these nails are pretty darn simple. Just a base of lime green with the tips in neon pink. Gotta love that pop, though!

Let’s see, what else has been happening… Oh! Hubby and I saw “How To Train Your Dragon 2″ on Friday – it was REALLY GOOD! If you liked the first one then you’ll DEFINITELY love the second one :) I heard Dreamworks has also confirmed a third movie, so excited! I am such a sucker for good animated films, and this was no exception <3

Speaking of animation, Netflix got “Death Note” and hubby and I have been watching through it again. I forgot what a freaking sociopath Light is! *laughs* But I was so pumped to see Netflix got it – I’ve been wanting to re-watch a few anime series and DN was one of them :)
