Happy Saturday, my lovelies, and happy October! My favorite time of the year has officially begun! Spooky scary skeletons and fall delight, followed by holiday sparkle and Christmas cheer! Oh and of course, I've been getting my PSL fix nonstop. ;)

Today's nails are the perfect fusion of fashion and geek: Deep green for those fall vibes and shiny gold for glitz and Zelda triforce.

I can't BELIEVE I haven't done these nails yet - triangle nail studs were MEANT for triforces!

I didn't want to just do triforces though, and so I added two thin bands of gold to the tip of each nail using gold striping tape.

I love this combo! Jewel tones and precious metals go together so nicely, don't they? ;)

That's it for me, my lovelies! Have a wonderful rest of your weekend!
