Happy Sunday, my lovelies! And a very happy Easter to you as well! Whether you celebrate Easter or not, I hope that this day brings some wonderful things to you. :)

This past week was pretty exciting – I’ve been approved to move on to the next phase at my hacker school! I’m not going to lie though, I’m pretty nervous – I hear that this second phase is the hardest. I’m sure I’ll have my work cut out for me, but I’ll just have to power through and kick some programming butt!

This week’s manicure is the DEFINITION of simple and cute. I just did each of my nails in a different pastel color, and then layered over them with white polka dots.

For dots this size, you have three options: you can simply use the built-in bottle brush (like I did for this manicure today), you can use dotting tools (which you can purchase online or in nail art supply shops), or you can make your own at home (which I demonstrated in this tutorial here).

I love the look of rainbow manicures, and this manicure is no exception! I thought white polka dots over pastel shades makes for a perfect Easter Sunday manicure, and I hope that you agree. :)

That’s about all I have for you today, my lovelies! I hope you have a wonderful Easter Sunday, and that this upcoming week is amazing. :)

Happy Easter, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
