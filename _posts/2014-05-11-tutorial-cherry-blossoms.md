Happy Sunday, my lovelies! And a very happy Mother’s Day to all of the mommies reading this post! :)

I think Mother’s Day is the perfect time to show off a springtime, floral manicure. Don’t you? ;) In this vein, let’s go ahead and get started with today’s post:

**Tutorial: Cherry Blossoms**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

– Clear base and top coat
– Nail polish in white, brown, and pink or red (I didn’t have the right pink at the time so I used red)
- A toothpick or small dotting tool
– A thin paint/makeup/polish brush
– A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer. Then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Base it! Take your white polish and paint your nails with 2-3 coats of it. We need a pretty backdrop for the tree branches!

Step 4: Branch it! Now take your brown polish and drip a few drops of it onto your paper/plastic. Then, using your thin brush, paint some spindly brown branches onto your fingernails.

Step 5: Blossom time! Now it’s time for the cherry blossoms themselves. Drip some of your red polish onto the paper/plastic and,  using your toothpick, dot some tiny flowers around your branches.

Step 6: Finish it! Once your polish has dried, seal your manicure with a top coat and clean up the edges. Tada! You have a cute floral manicure to show off in the (hopeful) sun this week. :)
