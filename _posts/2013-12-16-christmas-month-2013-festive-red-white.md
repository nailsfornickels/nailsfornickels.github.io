Happy Monday, my lovely readers! How was your weekend? How’s the weather in your area? It finally warmed up here, it was an average of 40 F this last week instead of the average of 10 F last week! *laughs*

So this week’s nails are less OVERT Christmas and more subtle Christmas. Red and white are classic Christmas colors, so I wanted to figure out a manicure using just those two colors. And did I luck out! I had some leftover faux white pearls and faux red jewels from previous manicure, so I knew I had to use those. And from there, this week’s nails were born!

On my left hand, I used a gorgeous red color on all of my nails, then painted the ring finger with white polish and placed faux red jewels on top.

And on my right hand I used painted all of the nails with the white polish, used the red polish for the fourth finger, and stuck faux white pearls on the red nail.

I quite like the combination of these nails! The manicure is very easy to do, all you need is some small, cute jewels from the scrapbooking section of your favorite craft store and polish in the color of your choice.
