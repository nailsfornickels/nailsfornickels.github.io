Good morning, my lovely readers! How are you today? I’m pretty darn sleep myself, was up far too late for a Sunday night. ;) I hope everyone’s doing well!

I thought I’d switch things up today a bit, so we’re going to have a pedicure tutorial instead of my usual manicures. And let’s throw in some love for the Nintendo “Mario” franchise while doing it! So let’s get started on our:

**Fandom Inspired: “Mario” Mushroom Pedicure**

Step 1: Supplies! For this pedicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat (which I forgot in the picture haha)
- Nail polish in red, green, white, black, and a pale tan/pink
- A piece of paper for dripping paint on
- A large dotting tool (I used the back of a pen)
- Tape or a rubber band
- A toothpick/small brush
- Something to separate your toes with

Step 2: Prep it! Trim, clean, and buff your toenails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Now, for this pedicure, I did the full mushrooms on my two big toes, and then just the mushroom “caps” on my smaller toes. So for this step I painted my big toes with the tan polish, and the small toes in alternating red and green.

Step 4: Wait, then paint! Wait until the polish has completely dried on your tan/pink toes and then, using the tape or rubber band, paint the upper half of your toe in the red or green (I did red on one foot, green on the other). This will be the “cap” of the mushroom.

Step 5: Dot it! Drip some of your white polish onto your piece of paper/plastic and, using your dotting tool, paint white dots onto the red and green parts of each of your toes.

(Side note: I messed up the dotting for the full mushrooms, but you get the idea! ;) )

Step 6: Make the eyes! Drip some black polish onto your piece of paper/plastic and, using your toothpick, paint two small vertical lines on the tan part of your toes. These are the “eyes” of the Mario mushrooms.

Step 7: Finish it! Finally, paint on a top coat and clean up the edges of your nails.

And voila! You have a totally rockin’ Mario-themed pedicure to show off the next time you’re slaying your friends at MarioKart. ;)
