Hello, my lovelies! Happy Sunday! Can you guys BELIEVE it's June already? I swear, one part of adulthood and getting older is that time goes by way faster than it did when you were a kid :O *laughs*

These nails were super easy but turned out so pretty! I love doing a simple contrast of one light and one dark color - it always results in such a pretty look!

As if it wasn't obvious, all you need to do nails like this is two colors and different sized dotting tools! You can buy very inexpensive dotting tools online (I got mine from Amazon), from beauty supply stores, or make your own like I demonstrated in [this post](/tutorial-polka-dots/).

Now that the weather's warming up it's been time to get outside more and more! Hubby and I did a 40 mile round trip bike ride to Palo Alto over Memorial Day weekend and that was super fun! Unfortunately I've been sick the past couple of days so there was no playing outside for me today :P Do you have any outdoor plans coming up? How are you planning to spend your summer?
