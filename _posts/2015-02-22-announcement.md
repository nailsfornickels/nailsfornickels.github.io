Hello, my lovelies! And happy Sunday!

I have an announcement for you all today: I’m going to be reducing the amount of posts I make on Nails for Nickels. I’ve been thinking about this for a while and I’ve decided it’s time.

I’m not stopping the site, so don’t worry! I’ve just been struggling for a long while with inspiration and finding time to make nail art. I’m no longer able to keep up with the once-a-week schedule that I’ve been following since October 2012. (Over two years – how time flies!)

I will update the site when I have new stuff to show you all, but it’s going to be pretty sporadic. I’m still around and I still have the archive for you to peruse, I’ve just lost time for the frequent updates.

Thank you all for your understanding, and for taking the time to check out my creations! You’re all super lovely, my lovelies!
