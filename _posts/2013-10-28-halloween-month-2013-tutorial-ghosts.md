Happy Monday, my spooky readers!

Today marks the final week of “Halloween Month 2013″! I’ve really enjoyed doing these tutorials, how have you liked them? :)

Let’s finish off the month with a classic Halloween look:

**Halloween Month 2013 Tutorial: Ghosts**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in black and white
- A large dotting tool
- A small dotting tool
- A toothpick
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 4: Dot it! Drip some white polish onto your paper/plastic and take out your large dotting tool.

Dip the large dotting tool into the white polish and paint a large white dot on the center of each of your nails.

Step 5: Ghost bottoms! Now take your white polish and, using the built-in brush, paint on the “bottom” parts of each ghost. To do this, I painted a small stroke from the bottom of the dot out to the left, and then a small stroke from the bottom of the dot to the right.

Step 6: Dot it! After the ghost “bodies” dry, take out your black polish and drip some onto the paper/plastic. Then, using your small dotting tool, paint on two eyes for each ghost.

Step 7: Mouth it! Drip some more black polish onto your paper/plastic if necessary, and take out your toothpick. Use the toothpick to paint “mouths” onto your ghosts, making sure the “mouths” are more oval-shaped (this will make them look more like they’re wailing/saying “Boo!”)

Step 8: Finish it! After the polishes have dried, seal your manicure with the clear top coat, clean up the edges, and voila!

So what are your plans for Halloween? I plan to eat candy and watch “The Nightmare Before Christmas” with my hubby and puppy! (It’s our little tradition and I am so very excited :) )
