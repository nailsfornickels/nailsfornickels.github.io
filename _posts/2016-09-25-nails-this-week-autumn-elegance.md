Happy Sunday, my lovelies! It's been quite a while, hasn't it? Last time we saw each other it was the beginning of summer, and now we've hit the start of fall. And I am SO excited! Fall is my favorite season: the colors, the flavors, and the sights are all so lovely!

(Has anyone else been living off of Pumpkin Spice lattes? I know I sure have haha)

Unfortunately, living in California means I don't get a ton of fall-like weather. D: But that just means I have to make my own fall on my fingertips!

Kept it cute and simple for this manicure since all I really wanted was some fall colors to kick off the new season. So I did a deep burgundy with some gold sparkles for a gradient on the tips.

I love love love this look! It was super quick to put on and it looks so gosh darn lovely :)

That's it for me today, my lovelies! Also, I'm VERY excited for October to start: let's just say I've got some fun things planned for Halloween month ;)

See you all next time!
