Good morning my lovely readers! Did you all have a nice weekend? Unfortunately for me the hubby got sick, which of course meant I also got sick, so my weekend was pretty much a feverish blur. :( Forgive me if today’s post is a bit short because of that!

So I don’t know how many of you have heard, but this past week in Colorado has been a bit SCARY. We got a ridiculous amount of rain, which in turn lead to severe flooding in a lot of areas. Fortunately I’m in an area that wasn’t hit by any flooding, but I do have some friends that came pretty close. If you could keep Colorado in your thoughts and/or prayers, it would be very appreciated!

As you can see, for this week’s nails I’ve done French tips with a twist! I painted the entire nail blue, added a silver sparkle overlay, and then painted the tips black. I like the look of this manicure quite a bit if I do say so myself. :)
