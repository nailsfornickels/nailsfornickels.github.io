Happy Monday my lovely readers! I have an exciting announcement!

I think I’ve mentioned this before, but: I. LOVE. FALL. I am OBSESSED! Fall is my absolute favorite season: I love the clothes (boots, scarves, and sweaters, oh my!), the food (pumpkin spice EVERYWHERE), and the weather (chilly, crunchy leaves, and just plain gorgeous!). So I decided that, for the entire month of October, I’m going to be doing Halloween nails. :) And without further ado (yes I know today is technically September 30th but I update on Mondays and I figured it’s close enough ;) ), let’s get the October nails started!

**Halloween Month 2013 Tutorial: Spider Webs**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:
-Clear base and top coat
-A piece of paper or plastic to drip polish on
-A thin paintbrush or toothpick
-Nail polish in two colors (I chose orange and black for Halloween, but you can do any colors you like! Another one that would look cool is black base with white spider webs)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer then paint your nails with the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint your nails with your base color. Do enough coats to get a solid color.

Step 4: Web it! Drip your web color on the piece of paper/plastic and get out your toothpick/paintbrush.

Take your web color and paint the lines of your spider webs. The way to get a nice web look is to paint downward sloping lines between each long line. For my nails I did diagonal partial webs on the tips of each nail, with a full spider web on the fourth finger of each hand.

Step 5: Finish it! Paint the nails with your clear top coat, clean up the edges, and you’re done!
