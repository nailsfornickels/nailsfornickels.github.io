Hello my lovelies! Did you have a fabulous weekend? I got to see “Start Trek: Into Darkness” (more like Lens Flare: The Movie haha) and it was so good! If you liked the first (2009) one, definitely check out the sequel :)

So this week I have a super fun tutorial that was inspired by what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest video games of all time: Double Fine Productions’ “Psychonauts”!

This manicure was inspired by the outfit of one of the camp trainers, Agent Milla Vodello.

Her design is very clearly mod and disco inspired, and when I was looking at her dress I knew I had to come up with a manicure for it. :) I hope you enjoy this tutorial!

**Fandom Inspired: “Psychonauts” Milla Vodello!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish color in orange, red, yellow, and pink
- Hole reinforcement stickers (available in any store’s office supply section)

Step 2: Paint it! After buffing and shaping your nails in the style you prefer, paint on the clear base coat. Once that is dried, paint on 2-3 coats of the red polish to give you a nice, solid color.

Step 3: Sticker it! Once the red polish is completely dried, lay down one of the stickers. Place the sticker so you have room to paint on the outside of the circle as well as the center.

Step 4: Paint it! With your sticker in place, get your yellow and orange polishes ready. Paint the orange polish in the small inside section of the sticker, and paint the yellow polish on the larger outside section.

After painting, peel away the sticker.

Step 5: Wait, Sticker, and Paint (again)! Once again, wait long enough between steps 4 and 5 for the new colors of polish to completely dry. (Watch an episode of “The Mentalist” while you wait, like I did! :) ) Once the colors are dry, take another reinforcement sticker and move it upwards to cover a section of the yellow paint. Paint the remaining part of your nail with the pink polish, and peel the sticker away.

Step 6: Finish it! Once the polish has dried, seal your manicure with a clear top coat and clean up the edges.

Voila, you’re done! You may not be able to levitate like the Psychonauts agents after you do this manicure, but you will definitely turn heads with this fun and funky Milla Vodello inspired manicure!
