Happy Sunday, my lovelies :)

This post will probably be a bit short today – I’ve had a rough week. The company I was hired by did some massive layoffs this last week, and the section I was going to be working for lost their funding. So I lost my job before I even got a chance to start :( But if I got hired once it means I can get hired again, right? I’ve just got to keep working hard and do my best :)

I didn’t really have a clear goal in mind for my nails this week, so I browsed through [my Pinterest nail art board](http://www.pinterest.com/thedragonbabe/nail-art/) for inspiration (always good when you’re in a creative slump!) I settle on bright colors and polka dots, and used [this](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/5c/88/cd/5c88cdb2d6ae7cd9d6ad6ac495b75448.jpg) image as inspiration for these (the pin didn’t have a link to the creator, so if anyone knows please let me know!)

Being honest, I’m not very thrilled with how these turned out. My white was very sheer, which can be nice for detail work, but it meant that the white dots weren’t very stark. I also ran into issues with bubbles :( Clearly this just hasn’t been my week! *laughs*

If you like this style, it’s really easy to replicate: paint your nails with your desired base color, and once that’s completely dry use hole reinforcement stickers to paint the French tip on. Use your dotting tool to make the dots while the sticker is still on, peel away the sticker and you’re done. Easy peasy!

That’s all I have for you today my lovelies. I hope you have an awesome week! I’ll see you next time <3
