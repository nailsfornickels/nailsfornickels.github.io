Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you all doing this week? And to my American/Canadian readers, happy Labor Day weekend!

Do you have any fun plans for the weekend? Mine so far has consisted of grocery shopping and organizing the apartment. *laughs* I lead a thrilling life! ;)

Anyhoo, I’m mixing it up a bit this week and showing you a pedicure I did a while back! I normally don’t put a lot of effort into my toes beyond a coat of polish, but sometimes I like getting a little fancy. This is an example of that ;)

**Nails This Week: Sparkly Toes**

For this pedicure, I did a base color in a cobalt blue. For the big toe I freehanded a silver arch (maybe I should have used tape haha), and then I glued crystals along the line of the arch. I also glued four small blue crystals in a diamond shape on the center of the big toe, and a single silver crystal on the center of each of the other nails.

As you can see, I was rushing the pedicure so it’s not as neat as most of my other nail art. But all this means is that I just have to keep practicing! As Jake the dog from Adventure Time says, “Sucking at something is the first step to being sort of good at something.” ;)

(Side note: I also need to figure out how the heck to take pictures of pedicures! Lol)

Well that’s all from me, my lovelies! Have a great week this week! I’ll see you next time <3
