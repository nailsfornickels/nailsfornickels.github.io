Good morning everyone! Hope you had a wonderful weekend! I got to see “Monster’s University” with my husband and sister yesterday, it was REALLY good! I definitely recommend it :)

This week I’ll be showing you how I did my nails for the wedding of a friend who got married recently. (I also did her nails for the wedding, and I’ll be showing you all the pictures of that soon!) I really enjoyed this one and it got a lot of compliments. So let’s get started!

**White Rose Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in a neutral shade (I did a light tan)
- White nail polish (for the roses)
- Green nail polish (for the leaves)
- A paintbrush or toothpick
- A small dotting tool
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails in the manner you prefer, then put on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once the base coat dries, paint on your neutral base color.

Step 4: Dot it! After the base color has dried, take your white polish and drip a small amount onto your piece of paper/plastic.

Then, using your dotting tool, place  dots of white on each nail. These will act as the “centers” of your roses, so space them out accordingly so your roses don’t overlap as you continue. For the size of my nails, I did three dots on the thumb, two dots on the index, middle, and ring fingers, and one dot on the pinky.

Step 5: Petals! Now take your paintbrush, drip some more white polish onto your paper/plastic, and begin drawing the “petals” of each rose. For the first one, paint a small curve just above the dot.

For the second one, draw a curve whose end is slightly above a part of the first petal. (Sorry it’s hard to describe what I mean in words, look at the picture! *laughs*)

And finally, for the third petal, paint a curve which starts beneath the second petal and ends above the first one. (Again, look at the picture ;) )

Step 6: Leaves! To complete the roses, take your green nail polish and paint small leaves by each of the roses.

Step 7: Finish it! Once the flowers have finished drying, paint on the clear top coat. Clean up the edges of your nails and voila, your manicure’s done!

As it’s summer, I’m sure a LOT of you have been invited to weddings. I thought this manicure was a great one to do for a wedding, but even if you aren’t going to any it’s also a great manicure for any time of the year. Roses never go out of style, in my opinion. ;)
