Happy Sunday, my lovelies! Quick & dirty post today – my nails have sadly been in HORRIBLE shape the past couple of weeks, as I haven’t had time to style them or take care of them like I should. So I have one of my backup posts to share with you today: very simple, just some light blue-gray nails with a silver accent nail.

I LOVE the accent nail trend. It’s a really great way to get yourself in the nail art spirit even if you don’t have any inspiration. And you’ve gotta love the simplicity of it – all you need is two different nail polishes! :)

So is everyone ready for this next week? Anything exciting coming up? I myself am PUMPED for Mockingjay! I don’t know which day I’m going to see it, but I am SOOOO excited! I absolutely adored Catching Fire, so I have high hopes for Mockingjay Part 1 :D
