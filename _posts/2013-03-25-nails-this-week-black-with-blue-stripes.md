Hello lovely readers!

I have another short “Nails This Week” post for you today, but don’t worry! I’ll have more tutorials starting next week ;)

For my nails this week, I painted them black and put crosses of blue striping tape on each nail. Then, to finish, I put small flower decals I had on each thumb.

To see more manicures I did with striping tape, check out my candy cane tutorial [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-candy-cane-manicure/), and my New Year’s Eve nails [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-new-years-eve-black-gold/).

Happy Monday all! See you next week! <3
