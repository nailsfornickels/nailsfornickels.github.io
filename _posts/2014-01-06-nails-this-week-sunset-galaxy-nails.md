Happy Monday, my lovelies! Wow it has been a COLD week huh? The average here in Denver has been 10 degrees Fahrenheit. I hope you’re all staying as safe and as toasty as you possibly can!

So nothing fancy going on this week, but I’ve done another type of galaxy nails for you! This time though, the colors are sunset themed instead of space themed. Sunsets lead to warm thoughts right? Do your nails like this and it’ll keep you mentally warm! ;)
