**New Year’s Eve Black & Gold**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need clear base and top coat, black nail polish, gold striping tape and cuticle trimmers or small scissors.

Step 2: Prep it & paint it! Clean and buff your nails the way you prefer and throw on the base coat. After it dries, paint your nails with the black polish.

Step 3: Stripe it! Once the polish dries, take your striping tape and design your nails. I did a fishnet pattern for my nails, but you can do whatever pattern strikes your fancy. :) Lay down the tape and clip off the ends, trimming the tape as close to the nail as possible.

Step 4: Finish it! Put on the clear top coat. I did a few coats to make sure that the tape stays on for multiple days.
