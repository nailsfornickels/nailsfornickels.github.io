Happy Sunday, my lovelies! And a happy, happy New Year! How was everyone's holiday season? Any resolutions/goals for the new year?

Hubby and I have had a very busy last few months! We moved up to San Francisco, I started at a new job, we went back home for Thanksgiving, and we went over to Europe for Christmas! It's been a very hectic but very enjoyable time, and I'm actually pretty excited to get back to a regular schedule and for things to be fairly laid-back for a while. :)

So not only have the last few months been full of fun but chilly travel, but this week is FULL of rain in the Bay Area! Because of that, I thought it'd be fun to do a more colorful post to bring warm-weather vibes to mind. If it isn't actually warm outside, at least my nails can be!

For these nails, I did a bright pink base, painted on some white roses, and then placed a turquoise jewel in the center of each flower. And then, because you know me and my love of sparkle, I did pure turquoise glitter on the ring finger of each hand.

That's all from me for this post! Stay warm/dry/safe with whatever weather you have, and I'll see you next time, my lovelies!
