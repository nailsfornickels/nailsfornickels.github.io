Happy weekend, my lovelies! And for my readers in the U.S., happy Labor Day weekend! Does anyone have fun plans for the three day break? Hubby and I just got back from our anniversary trip to Hawaii (it was so wonderful!), so we're staying pretty low-key for this weekend. Also: it is HOT. The high temps for yesterday and Friday were 106 degrees fahrenheit! Let's just say thank goodness for AC ;)

I've got some end-of-the-summer sparkle for you all today! For these nails I did a lilac base color, painted on a sparkle coat, and then added some gold studs. Because you can NEVER get to shiny when it comes to your nails ;)

Oh random side note for Harry Potter fans - did you know Friday was the date of the epilogue for the series? I found that out yesterday and it made me so happy! I wonder how all the new first years are doing at Hogwarts. :)

That's all from me! Stay cool, my lovelies!
