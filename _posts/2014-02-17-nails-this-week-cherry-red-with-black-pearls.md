Happy Monday, my lovely readers! And for my American followers, happy President’s Day! Are you excited for the three day weekend? ;) I know I am!

This week’s nails are actually what I ended up having on Valentine’s Day. My hearted French mani got messed up (life demands we use our fingers, after all! ;) ) and I COULDN’T go without polish on Friday! Fortunately, I had some supplies on hand to make a quick and easy manicure.

As you can see, all this required was a cherry red nail polish, base and top coat, and some faux black adhesive pearls I got from a craft store. Unfortunately, when I put the top coat on the black coating on the pearls began to smear! I avoided the effect as much as I could, but I did get some tiny black streaks in the manicure here and there. :P

Oh goodness my cuticles look beaten up in this shot… *laughs* Nevertheless I really like this manicure. It only took a few minutes to put together, and I love how it came out! Plus, it’s a 3-D/texture mani, and I can’t say no to those. ;)
