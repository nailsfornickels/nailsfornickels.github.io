Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How was your week? Are you having a nice weekend? It’s been pretty rainy here in the Bay Area, but I’m not complaining – it sounds nice and we desperately need the moisture! Except hubby and I got caught in a bit of a downpour yesterday without umbrellas so that was less fun ;)

Tomorrow is a pretty big, nerve-wracking day for me: I start my hacker school classes to become a full-fledged programmer! I’m enrolled in a 9-week, super intensive program that teaches you the skills you need to enter the field as a basic software engineer, and my first day is in downtown SF tomorrow. It’s exciting, but I’m also nervous!

To celebrate the start of this new part of my life, I did my nails programming style ;) Because no matter what language you work with, everyone who codes needs two things to get the job done: a text editor and the shell. For my nails I painted the Mac icons for Sublime Text 3 (my absolute favorite text editor), and the Mac Terminal. Excluding the thumbs, which I just painted black and then tipped white, I used tape on all my nails to get the square polish. I then drew thin black lines around each square with a black Sharpie, and filled in the “S” for Sublime and the “>_” for Terminal using a very small dotting tool (this could also be accomplished with a small paintbrush or a toothpick).

I had a lot of fun making this manicure! Unfortunately, as I was busy the entire time I was working on the manicure, a fair amount of air bubbles got trapped in the polish. :( But even though it’s imperfect, I’m still proud of this manicure I made for programmers :) I hope you like it too! (And if you just have absolutely NO idea what I’ve been talking about this post, don’t worry – more standard nail art will resume next week ;) )

Wish me luck with my program, everyone! It will be intense, but I know it will be great. Have an awesome week this week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
