Happy Monday everybody!

This week, I thought we’d take a break from manicures that require fancy, you-probably-don’t-have-this-lying-around-the-house supplies, and move back to basic all-you-need-is-scotch-tape-and-imagination ones ;)

So this week, I present:

**Tri-Colored Points!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you need:

- Clear base coat
- Clear top coat
- Tape (for making the lines)
- 3 nail polish colors of your choice (I chose white, grey, and black)

Step 2: Paint it! Buff and style your nails in the manner you prefer, then put on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Tape & Paint it! Once the base coat dries, take a piece of tape and lay it at an angle on your nail (this will be the line for the first point). Paint on your first color.

Step 4: Tape it & Paint it [after color 1 is dry]! Once your first color is fully dried (not tacky at ALL), take TWO pieces of tape (to form a triangle for your center point), and place it on your nail. Paint your second point in between the two pieces.

Finished point should look like the picture below.

Step 5: Tape it & Paint it the last time! Once your second color is fully dried, orient a third piece of tape like you did for the first color on the opposite side of the nail, and paint on your final color.

Once the last color is fully dried, seal your manicure with the clear top coat, clean up the edges, and you’re done! This manicure is extremely easy and looks super cool, it just takes time to do because you have to wait so long between each color. I hope you enjoy!
