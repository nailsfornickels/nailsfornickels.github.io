Happy Sunday, my lovelies! So I have an exciting piece of news:

I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WATER MARBLING! *cheers*

I've given this technique a try a couple of times but I could never get it to work, so I sort of gave up for a while. But I've seen a few really nice, very helpful video tutorials and thought I'd give it a try again. And it worked! So while I feel that I still have a ways to go in terms of nice uniform swirls, I think I've got it well enough to give you all a tutorial :) So without further ado, let's get started with:

**Tutorial: Water Marble Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- 3 to 5 nail polishes in the colors of your choosing (I chose a sky blue, light gray, dark green, and silver)
- A glass or container filled with water
- Scotch tape (to wrap around your nails to ease clean up
- Toothpicks

(I switched to silver after taking this picture, lol)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once the clear base is dried, paint your nails with a coat of one of the polish colors. No need for multiple coats - this just ensures there's color everywhere if there happen to be any gaps in the marble.

Step 4: Drip it! Now take your water and begin dripping your polish into it. Dip the brush of your polish into the bottle, and take it out with a good amount of polish on it. Hover the brush over the water and let a drop of the polish fall.

(Note: DON'T let the brush touch the surface of the water - it won't allow the polish to spread out.

Once one color has spread out, drip another color in the center of the first. Layer in this fashion with all of your colors.

Step 5: Drag it! Now take your toothpick and, hovering it JUST at the surface of the polish, drag towards the center of your polish dots. Do this around the circumference of the polish to get some cool swirls.

Step 6: Tape it! Take your scotch tape and wrap it around the base and sides of your nail. This will make clean up much easier after :)

Step 7: Dip it! Now take your nail and dip it, nail first, into the surface of the polish and down into the water.

Step 8: Swirl it! Now take another toothpick and drag it around your finger, gathering up the excess polish. Place this to the side, wipe off the toothpick or throw it away.

Step 9: Lift it! Once the polish is cleared away, gently pull your finger from the water.

Peel away your tape to reveal the lovely swirls!

Step 10: Finish it! Once the water has dried, seal your nail with the clear top coat. Repeat this process on every nail you want marbled, clean up the edges and voila! Water marble nails!

I figured out what made my earlier attempts at water marbling fail - I wasn't clearing away the polish on the surface of the water before pulling the finger out. This step is CRUCIAL - don't skip it!

Also, as a note to you, my lovely reader: I'm about to be switching the site to some new technologies. The URL will remain the same, but don't be surprised if you visit and everything looks different. Still me, but new look! :)
