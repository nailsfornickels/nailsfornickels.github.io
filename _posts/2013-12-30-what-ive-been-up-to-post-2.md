Happy Monday, my wonderful followers! Did you all have a wonderful Christmas? I hope you got everything you wanted and that it was a wonderful day! And if it wasn’t something you enjoyed, I’m glad it’s over for you now. :)

So I’ve been doing a lot of tutorials, but it’s been a while since I’ve told you all what I’m up to. So howzabout I update you on the various nail art shenanigans I’ve been up to? Let’s get started!

**First: Megan’s Wedding Guest Nails**

For my amazing friend Megan who had a wedding to attend, I did silver and black ombre nails to match her pretty black dress.

She was quite happy with the nails, so I was quite happy as well!

**Second: Hope’s College Nails**

For my fantastic sister-in-law Hope, I had to give her a manicure before she left for college! She requested black nails with silver crosses, so I used my silver striping tape for this manicure.

In case you don’t know, striping tape is often used for the paint jobs on model cars. But you can use it for nail art too! I bought mine from Amazon, and it’s pretty darn inexpensive.

**Third: Hannah’s College Nails**

I did a lot of college nails this summer! For the wonderful  Hannah, I also gave her a free manicure as a going-away present for her first semester at college. She loves velvet nails, so we did a fancy French manicure with blue and white velvet!

To do velvet nails at home, check out the scrapbooking section of your local craft store. The material I used is called “flocking powder”, and it’s commonly used as the faux grass on model train sets. But it’s also used for scrapbooking and, as I’ve shown, you can use it for nail art! If it’s not at your local art/craft store, you can also buy it online like I did for my striping tape. :)

**Fourth: Molly’s College Nails**

And for the final update on what I’ve been up to, it’s more college nails! The lovely Molly also got a free going-away manicure for her first semester in college, and she absolutely adored the feather nails.
