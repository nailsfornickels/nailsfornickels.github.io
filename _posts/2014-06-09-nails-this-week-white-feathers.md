Happy Sunday, my lovelies! I’m sorry about the late post – I left for my exercise class and when I got out I went “Shoot! Blog post!” *laughs* But better late than never, right? ;)

This week I’ve gone back to an oldie but a goodie – feather nails! This time I did the feathers over a white base, which I think really makes them pop :)

I’ve been slowly but surely depleting my supply of these brown and black feathers – I think it might be time to pick up some new ones soon! Is there any particular color / style you’d like to see me do with feathers? Please let me know in the comments below :)

Other than feathery nails, my life is pretty much the same as it was last week. All of my time for the forseeable future is dedicated to job hunting. Hey, by the way, if any of you are slash know someone looking for a web developer in the California Bay Area, let me know! ;)

(Side note: This nail turned out the best, IMO <3 )

Let’s see, what else is going on… The weekend has been very relaxing. Went on a leisurely hike with hubby and puppy yesterday, going to a local farmer’s market today, and otherwise just enjoying life and this lovely summer weather! What do YOU have going on this weekend? And any fun fourth of July plans for my American readers?
