Happy Monday, my wonderful readers! How was your weekend? Mine was pretty low-key, but certainly enjoyable. :)

This week we’re taking a break from tutorials, and I decided to show off some Chevron-style nails I did a little while ago.

I really love the Chevron look! And it’s so versatile; change up the colors and you can get a style that’s perfect for any time of the year.

It was so tough getting the pictures right for this manicure – the colors were all darker, so in most of the shots it was hard to tell that there were three separate colors. But I got there eventually! ;)
