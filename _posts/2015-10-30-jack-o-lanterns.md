Happy Friday and HAPPY HALLOWEEN (tomorrow) my lovelies! Do you all have some spooky plans? Going to see a scary movie, take the kids trick or treating, venture into a haunted house or check out a party? Whatever you do I hope it's a blast and a half <3 For myself hubby and I are going to have our favorite tradition: candy and The Nightmare Before Christmas!

To wrap up the month of Halloween, I have some nails that no October would be complete without: 

**Jack O' Lanterns!**

Now let's get started :)

Step 1: Supplies! For these nails you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Orange nail polish
- EITHER black nail polish and a toothpick/thin brush or a black permanent marker

Clean, buff, and polish your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 2: Orange it! Take your orange polish and paint on 2-3 coats to get a nice solid base color.

Step 3: Triangles! Now take your black polish OR marker and paint two triangles side-by-side near the base of your nail.

Step 4: Smile! First thing you do is paint/draw a thin curved line near the tip of your nail.

Step 5: Teeth! For the 'teeth' of your jack o'lanterns, you're going to paint alternating squares. So on the top of the mouth-line, draw a small black square. Then just to the side of it, below the mouth-line, draw another solid square.

Continue this until you've reached the end of the mouth! (For me it was an average of three on top and two on bottom, but it will vary depending on the size of your squares and of your nails)

Step 6: Finish it! Wait until the black has dried and seal your manicure with the clear top coat. Clean up the edges of your nails and voila! Some spooky and cute gourds to finish up this Halloween month!

I hope everyone's been having an awesome Halloween so far! I'm off to go get some bubble tea and dinner and then it's an evening of relaxing for me, hubby, and puppy.
