Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How was this week for you? I hope it was wonderful, and that you’re having an equally wonderful weekend!

From my almost three months of living here, I have found that there are essentially three types of weather in the California Bay Area. There is sunny and (usually) warm, overcast & a bit dreary, and overcast with lots and lots of rain. Sun, fog, and rain is what I’ve been getting from the Bay winter into spring lol. The last couple of weeks particularly have been riddled with several overcast and pouring days, so this week’s post is very fitting for the weather:

**Gray Ombre!**

Very simple, but I think very fitting. :) I love love LOVE the look of ombre manicures, and these two gray polishes worked together very well.

Today is another overcast day (at least it is this morning), but to tell you the truth I love gray and rainy days. So I think I moved to the perfect place for myself! Sunny and chilly and full of awesome things. :)

And that’s all for me, my lovelies! I have some homework to get to (never thought I’d say that again but you do with hacker schools haha) as well as some tidying up around the apartment. Sounds like the recipe for a thrilling Sunday, eh? ;) *laughs* I hope EVERYONE has a lovely finish to their weekend, and that this week has some great things in store for each and every one of you.

Have a great week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
