Hello dear readers! It’s only been a week, but it feels like it’s been forever. Have you all had a fabulous week? I certainly hope you have :)

As I promised last week, I have a tutorial for you today! Please allow me to present:

**Starry, Starry Night (A.K.A. Galaxy) Nails!**

Step 1: Supplies! A lot of color is involved in this manicure, since the idea is to mimic the look of the night sky/ the colors of outer space. For mine, I used:

- Makeup sponges
- Piece of paper/plastic (to dab paint on)
- Clear base and top coat
- Glitter/sparkle polish (for the stars)
- Various colors of your choosing for the sky. I did royal blue, grey, black, purple, and turquoise

(Side note: Whoops! Forgot the black polish in the picture, haha)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean and shape your nails in the way you desire, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! After the base coat has dried, you’re going to paint on your base color. For mine, I used the royal blue, since that’s the most prevalent color in the night sky. :)

Step 4: Get the colors ready! Once your base color is dried, you’re ready to get the other colors ready.
Take your piece of paper, and one by one dab a few drops of each color onto the paper. Keep them close together, as you’re going to be sponging all of them onto your nails. I did a couple of formations, because you use a lot of paint with this manicure.

Step 5: Dab it! Press the makeup sponge into the paint, and then dab in small up and down motions across your nail. (To get more detail on this technique, check out my [Fall Ombre Colors tutorial](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-ombre-fall-colors/)) You may have to repeat this step a few times to make sure all of the colors are visible on your nails.

Step 6: Star it! Once the colors are dried, paint/scatter on your sparkle polish/glitter to mimic stars in the night sky.

Step 7: Finish it! When your nails are dried, clear up the edges of your nails and seal the manicure with the clear top coat.

This tutorial is inspired by two things: the Aurora Borealis, and this awesome quote from Doctor Who:

“Look at the sky. It’s not dark and black and without character. The black is in fact deep blue. And over there! Lighter blue. And blowing through the blueness and the blackness, the winds swirling through the air. And there shining, burning, bursting through, the stars! Can you see how they roar their light? Everywhere we look, complex magic of nature blazes before our eyes!”
