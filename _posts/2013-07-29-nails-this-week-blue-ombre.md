Good morning, my fabulous readers! Happy Monday! I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend, and that you all have some fun things coming up this week. :)

For this week’s post I thought I’d slow things down a bit and show off these blue ombre nails I did.

The combination of these two blue polishes looked absolutely STUNNING. I found myself staring at my fingers quite a bit. ;)
