Happy Monday, my lovelies! How was your weekend? Any fun plans for this week? I hope that it’s a good one no matter what you do!

I’ve got some funky nails for you today: Blue Mod! I absolutely adore blue nail polish, so when I was doing this manicure it obviously had to be in blue shades!

Doing a manicure like this is really simple! All you need is some time, multiple nail polish colors, and hole reinforcement stickers. To see how to do it at home, check out my [Fandom Inspired: Psychonauts’ Milla Vodello](http://nailsfornickels.com/fandom-inspired-psychonauts-milla-vodello/) tutorial.

I love doing my nails in this style because it’s so versatile! You can choose practically any color combination and it’s guaranteed to turn heads.
