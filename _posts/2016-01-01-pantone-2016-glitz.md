Happy Friday and Happy New Year my lovelies! How's everyone doing today? Did you have a nice New Year's Eve? Did you stay safe?? Hubby and I had a very quiet evening at home - we're re-bingeing Jessica Jones! I'm in love with that show forever and ever <3 

To kick off the new year, I got an awesome idea from one of my favorite nail art blogs: Nail Pornography! (check them out [here](http://www.nailpornography.tumblr.com)) They have a weekly nail art contest and the theme this week is Pantone's color(s) of the year for 2016: [Rose Quartz and Serenity](http://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2016)!

So here's to a gorgeous new year, and let's kick off 2016 with:

You know what I've found? Whenever I have a general idea for a manicure (like color schemes) but no idea what to do with it, I always reach for my gems! When in doubt: lots of sparkle!

I love Pantone's choice for colors this year: don't they look so gorgeous together?? I'm always a sucker beautiful color combos. <3 They remind me of the edges of sunrise.
