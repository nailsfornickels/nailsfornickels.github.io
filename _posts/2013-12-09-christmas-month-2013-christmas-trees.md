Happy Monday, my lovelies!

Oh my heaven, this last week was COLD. I think the highest it got around here was… 15-20 degrees F? Crazy! It was gorgeous the first couple of days, but now I’m bored with the chill haha.

And of course we’re continuing Christmas month this week with some more classic Christmas-y nails, so let’s get started with some:

**Christmas Trees**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Base color of your choice (I chose a nude tan)
- Polish in green, red, and gold (or whatever decoration colors you prefer!)
- Scotch tape
- Striping tape
- Cuticle nippers/manicure scissors (to snip your striping tape into small pieces)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff and shape your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint all of your nails with the base color.

WAIT until the base color is COMPLETELY dry (so you can rub your nails together without any tack) before proceeding onto the next step. ;)

Step 4: Tape it! Place two pieces of scotch tape over your nail so it creates a blank space in the shape of a triangle. Then, using 2-3 pieces of striping tape, place them at angles across the blank space. This will create the “garland” on the tree.

Take out your green polish and paint the nail with 1-2 coats (to get a nice, solid green).

Give the polish a moment to air dry, and then peel away the tape (peel away the striping tape one by one, then peel away the scotch tape).

Step 5: Decorate it! Now take out your “decoration” colors and have some fun! You can use a dotting tool for this if you like, but I had no trouble just doing tiny dots of polish with the bottle’s built-in brush. :) For my trees, I did a gold dot on top and red ornaments, but you can decorate your trees however you darn well please (heck, they don’t even have to be green! Make them silver or purple, just be sure they’re your own ;) )

Put your decoration topper on top, and the ornaments in random places on the tree itself.

Step 6: Finish it! Let the polish dry, seal your manicure with the clear top coat, and clean up the edges. Voila!

Now you can “rock around the Christmas tree” any time, because you’ll have Christmas trees with you all the time! (Yeah… that was painful to type, haha).

For my followers who celebrate Christmas, how’s the season going for you so far? And for my followers who don’t observe this particular holiday, how is your December going so far? I hope it’s warmer where you are than it is here in Colorado, or that you have a quality heater!
