Hello, my lovelies! Long time no see, eh? I promised I wasn't going anywhere ;) How's everyone doing? It's been over half a year since I last posted, how the time flies!

Between my [last post](/nails-this-week-valentines-day-2015-ombre-hearts) and now I suppose a lot has happened! I turned 25, went to Disneyland for the first time this summer, hubby and I celebrated our anniversary in New York, showed my family and hubby's parents around California, and just had my one-year anniversary as a professional software engineer!

And oh hey, I got an undercut a few months ago ;) (Please ignore my messy apartment lol)

It feels great to be back! Taking a break is amazing for getting the creative juices going, and I'm ready to show off some nail art! Of course, October is a great month to be back because making Halloween-themed nails are my FAVORITE, so here we go!

Starting rather simple but hey, it's been a while and you've gotta walk before you can run * laughs *

For these nails I did a solid orange base, created an orange and black ombre using [this](/tutorial-ombre-fall-colors) technique, and threw on a subtle gradient of gold glitter.

I like to think of these as Halloween Glam! Classic colors of orange and black, and then throw in that always-necessary glitter :D

Fairly quick today, but like I said, I'm super excited to be back! I'll see you next time my lovelies - have a great week! <3
