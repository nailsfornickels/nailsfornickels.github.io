Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you all doing today? I hope you’re doing wonderfully! I have a fun tutorial for you all today, so let’s get started:

**Tutorial: Cherry Blossoms 2 (with Bonus Coordinated Toes)**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you’re going to need:

- Clear base & top coat
- Base color in mint green
- Nail polish in brown, pink, light pink, and (optional) pink sparkles
- Dotting tool
- Thin paint/makeup brush
- Angled paint/makeup brush
- Piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the shape you desire then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Use 2-3 coats of the mint green to get a solid base color.

Step 4: Branch it! Now take the brown polish, drip some onto the piece of paper/plastic, and use your thin paintbrush to paint branches on each of your nails.

Step 5: Flower it! First, take your regular pink polish, drip some on the paper/plastic, and use your angled brush to paint small pink blossoms on the branches.

Step 6: Flower it (again)! Now take the dotting tool and, after dripping some of the light pink polish onto the paper/plastic, dot some of the light pink at the bases of the pink blossoms.

Step 7: Sparkle it! If you like, you can throw some dots of pink sparkle onto the blossoms to get some shine!

Step 8: Finish it! Seal your manicure with your clear top coat, clean up the edges, and voila!

I had a lot of fun doing these! Also, it was unintentional, but these are TOTALLY Arizona Green Tea nails! *laughs*

Oh and in addition, I also made my toenails match! I did the same colors (mint base and pink flowers), and I used the flower accent technique for the big toes.

Oh gosh, my poor pinkie toe always looks so forlorn hahaha.
(Side note: I took these pics on my bed, and do you LOVE my new quilt?? Because I totally do!)
