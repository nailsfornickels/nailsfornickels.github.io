Hey all, and welcome to another Nails for Nickels tutorial!

Halloween is over, and even though retail stores would disagree with me, I still think it’s a bit early to start the Christmas-themed manicures ;) So this week let’s do a manicure that works for any time of the year:

Glitter Tips!

Step 1: Supplies. For this manicure, you’ll need scotch tape, clear base/top coat, a small bowl, nail polish and glitter! Since the glitter I used was purple, I used a purple nail polish. But the coating of glitter covers up the polish, so I don’t think you’ll have any problems if your glitter and polish don’t match :)

Side Note: Before beginning the manicure, pour the glitter into the small bowl so that it’s ready to go when the time comes.

Step 2: Clean and prepare your nails however you prefer, and paint with a clear base coat.

Step 3: Scotch it! After the base coat dries, cover your nails with scotch tape while leaving the tips exposed.

Step 4: Paint it! Paint the exposed nail tips with the colored polish.

Step 5: Before the paint dries, dip your finger in the glitter bowl so the glitter sticks to the wet polish.

Step 6: Pull out your finger, and shake/blow off the excess glitter!

Step 7: Peel off the tape to reveal the stripe of glitter.

Step 8: Seal your manicure with top coat, and your glitter tips are done!

Side note: Be aware, I accidentally RUINED my bottle of top coat this first time, because the glitter stuck to the brush so when I put the brush back in it contaminated the clear paint. So when you’re doing this mani, clean off the brush before dipping it back in the bottle :)
