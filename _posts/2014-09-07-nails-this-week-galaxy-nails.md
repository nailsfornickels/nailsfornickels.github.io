Happy Sunday, my lovelies! Today’s post is going to be a bit short because I’m busy studying for some interviews I have this week. :) But what’s going on with all of you? Any exciting news? Are some of you back in school? I hope life’s going wonderfully!

This week I decided to do some galaxy nails – I haven’t done this look in a long time! I love combining colors, and the results from this manicure were so pretty. Each type of light (fluorescent, regular, sunlight, etc.) made them shine in a different way! So pretty!

(Plus the barista at my nearby Starbucks complimented them, and that always means you’ve done a good job with your nails in my book ;) ) To learn how to do your own multicolored galaxy-esque nails, check out my tutorial [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-starry-starry-night/).

Let’s see, what else… Oh! My mom’s coming into town this week, so I’m really excited! I’m gonna show her around the Bay Area and it’ll be a blast and a half :)
