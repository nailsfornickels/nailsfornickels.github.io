Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in black, white, red, and skin color of your choice (I chose gray because, despite what many franchises would have you believe, vampires are DEAD and have no blood ;) )
- Scotch tape (if you want to make sure your lines are straight)
- Thin dotting tool (you can also use a toothpick if you don't have dotting tools)
- Black sharpie (this is optional, I used that but you can also use black nail polish and toothpicks!)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Base color! Once the base coat has dried, paint on 2-3 coats of your base color polish â€“ enough to get a solid background for your vamps.
