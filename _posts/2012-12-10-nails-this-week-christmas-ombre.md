Hey all! As of December 3rd I officially FINISHED my Christmas shopping. Feels great! Except I love buying presents for people, so I still have the urge to buy stuff haha.

Has everyone gotten started on their shopping? Christmas Eve is two weeks from today, so if you haven’t started you should get on that!

This week, continuing the theme of Christmas manicures, I did red and green ombre! I did red base on one hand, and green base on the other, and I think I like the green base fading into red in the tips more. The red I used had sparkles in it, so I like the effect of gradually getting sparkly on the tips.

To see how to do the ombre/gradient effect on your nails, see my tutorial [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/nails-this-week-christmas-ombre/).
