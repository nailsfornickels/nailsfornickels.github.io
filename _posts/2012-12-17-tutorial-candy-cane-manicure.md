Hey everybody!

Christmas is next week, eeeeee!!!! I can’t even tell you how excited I am, this absolutely my favorite time of the year. :)

This week we’re continuing the Christmas-themed manicures, and are drawing inspiration from one of the most popular holiday treats: candy canes!

Now there are two ways of doing this, and both involve striping tape. In case you don’t know, striping tape is extremely thin tape that is used for detailed painting. It’s often used for painting models, but it is also used for nail art! I bought my tape from Amazon, but you might also be able to get it at a model or crafts store.

**Candy Cane Method 1: Tape as a Stencil**

Step 1: Supplies! For this method, you’ll need clear base and top coat, red polish, white polish, and striping tape.

Step 4: Tape it! Take the striping tape, cut off 3-4 pieces (depending on the size of your nail [I used 4 for my thumbs and 3 for the other fingers]) and tape them onto the nail once the red paint dries.

Step 6: Remove it! Peel off the tape to reveal the red stripes underneath.

To finish, clean up the edges and throw on a clear top coat and you’re done!

**Candy Cane Method 2: Tape as the Stripes**

Step 1: Supplies! For this method, you’ll need clear base and top coat, white paint, red striping tape, and cuticle cutters (or small scissors).

Use the cuticle trimmers to cut the tape as close to the nail edges as possible.

To finish, paint the nails with the clear top coat.

And there you have it! Two ways to do candy cane nails for the holiday season.

Happy Monday everybody! See you next time! :)
