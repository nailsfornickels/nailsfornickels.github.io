Happy Monday, my lovelies! How are you all doing today? For my American readers, did you have a nice Fourth of July?

The first part of my week was great! My husband and I have some friends from out of town stay over, and I got to show them around the city and have a general blast. :) But then over the weekend our puppy got REALLY sick and we have to take her to the animal ER :( She’s doing better now, but it was really scary! So needless to say I’ve had an eventful week since my last post. *laughs*

Now even though every weekly post I make is about what I’ve done with my nails and how you can do the same at home, I also do nails for my friends and family a lot! So this week I thought I’d slow things down a bit and take a break from the tutorials and such to show you some of the things I’ve been up to lately. :) Let’s go!

**First: Wedding Nails!**

A very close friend of mine got married in June, and I had the honor of doing her fingers and toes for the wedding. I forgot to get a shot of her toenails (Deep royal purple! Very pretty!), but I did make sure that I took some pictures of her fingernails. The colors of her wedding were white, black, and purple, so for her nails she wanted me to do white nails with black lace tips.

Her nails turned out so lovely! But they didn’t come anywhere close to how beautiful the bride was on her wedding day. :)

**Two: Dalek Nails!**

As I mentioned earlier, some friends from out of town came to visit us last week. So, obviously, I had to do their nails before they left! The first girl LOVES Doctor Who, so what better nails to do than Daleks?

(Side note: I didn’t get the chance to get a shot of the nails with the edges cleaned up, but you get the idea. ;) )

These nails are SO much fun to create, and she absolutely loved them. :)

**Three: House Stark Nails!**

The other gal who stayed with us was making her way through the “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series, so obviously we had to do a manicure related to that. And when she saw my post on the “Game of Thrones” house colors (seen [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/fandom-inspired-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-house-colors/)) she knew that she wanted a manicure with the colors of House Stark.

(Again, forgot to get a shot with the edges cleaned up! My bad!)

I’m happy to report that she loved these! :)

**Four: Pearl Toes!**

And finally, a pedicure to wrap up the post. Now this was actually one I did on myself instead of someone else, but I got a lot of compliments on it. Plus, I hardly ever show you dear readers my pedicures, so let’s change that today eh?

I found some small adhesive faux pearls at Michaels, and decided to throw them on top of a GORGEOUS light teal polish I have.

(Please ignore the lighting and my silly looking toes! *laughs*)

So that’s what I’ve been up to lately! And I just want to say thank you to all of the wonderful people who read this blog. I love bringing you tutorials and nail ideas every week, and I hope you stick around with me to see what fun nail art we can come up with in the future.

Have a GREAT Monday, everyone! I’ll see you next time. <3
