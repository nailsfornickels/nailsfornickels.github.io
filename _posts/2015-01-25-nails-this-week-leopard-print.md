Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How’s everyone doing today? :) I’m doing very well – finally feeling better! I guess I caught a cold from someone at work, but I was on the couch sick as a dog all of last weekend :( So happy to be feeling better!

This week I kept things funky – leopard print! I actually had two friends not believe me when I said I had done these myself – they were sure I had used nail wraps! Just goes to show you how nail art doesn’t have to be complicated in order to be awesome. ;)

To learn how to do your own leopard print nails, check out my tutorial [here](/tutorial-leopard-print/). (The best part is, you don’t have to stick to regular colors! You can do any color leopard print you like :D)

Any fancy plans for anyone this week? It’s pretty quiet around here – the post-holiday and pre-summer time of year is pretty darn uneventful! *laughs*
