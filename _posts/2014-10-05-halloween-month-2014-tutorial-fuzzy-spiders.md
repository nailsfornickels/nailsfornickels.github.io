Happy Sunday, my lovelies! But more importantly:

HAPPY OCTOBER!

You know what that means? That’s right! It’s time for another month of creepy, crawly, spooky Halloween-themed nails! :D So let’s start the month off right with the most numerous creepy crawlies in the world:

**Tutorial: Fuzzy Spiders**

Step 1: Supplies! For this tutorial, you will need:

- Clear base coat
- Nail polish in the base color of your choice (I chose white, but I think orange would also be great for Halloween!)
- Black nail polish
- Black flocking powder
- One small and one large dotting tool
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on and capture excess powder

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on some clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once your base coat has dried, paint your nails with 2-3 coats of your base color – enough so that the color is solid without any streaking.

NOTE: Complete steps 4 – 6 one nail at a time to ensure that the flocking powder will still have wet polish to stick to.

Step 4: Dot it! Take your large dotting tool and, after dripping some black polish onto your paper/plastic, paint a large black dot somewhere on your nail. IMMEDIATELY proceed to step 5.

Step 5: Powder it! When the black dot is on, sprinkle your flocking powder over the polish. To learn more about flocking powder and applying it, check out my “Velvet Nails” tutorial [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-velvet-nails/).

Step 6: Legs, legs, legs! Now take your small dotting tool this time and, after dipping it in some more black polish, paint four tiny legs on each side of your large black dot. Follow the same routine as you did for the spider body: polish then immediately powder.

Step 7: Finish it! Use a small makeup brush to brush away any remaining excess powder (it gets everywhere!), clean up the edges of your nails, and voila!

So are you all excited for the fall months and for Halloween? I wish the weather outside matched the time of year! I love living in NorCal, but I definitely miss the chill of autumn in Denver. It’s so gosh darn hot! *laughs*

Oh and in other news, I had my first week at my new job this last week! I’m still sort of in the onboarding process, but so far I think it’s going well :) And my hubby starts his new job tomorrow, so it’s just a time of change and awesome new things at our home! What sort of awesome new things are happening with you?
