Happy Monday all! Did you have a good weekend, lovely readers? I had a pretty awesome week last week, I got in to grad school! *throws confetti and dances around* That, combined with my brother turning 21 and my hubby getting an awesome new job means that last week was an awesome week. :) Let’s hope that trend continues this week too!

Just a quick post for you guys today: for St. Patrick’s Day yesterday I did Green Velvet Nails!
