Happy Thursday everybody!

So I have a quick bonus post for you today: my sister’s high school prom was last week, and I did nails for her and a couple of her friends. I thought I’d show you the results, and I hope you enjoy them :)

For the first lovely lady, who was wearing a gorgeous purple halter dress, I did her toenails in a purple and black ombre with a silver sparkle overlay:

For the second lovely lady, who was wearing a gorgeous beaded blue spaghetti strap dress, I did mint green nails with silver tiger stripes:

And finally, for the third lovely lady, who was wearing a gorgeous floral-print black and red dress (That her and her mom made themselves! Too cool!), I did red velvet on all nails except for the fourth finger of each hand, which had red polish with gold striping tape in a chevron shape:

I LOVE doing other people’s nails, and I had such a fun time making their hands and toes look gorgeous for the dance. You look fabulous, ladies!

See you next time <3
