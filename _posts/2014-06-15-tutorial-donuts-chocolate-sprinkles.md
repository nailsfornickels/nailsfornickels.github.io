Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you doing on this fine day? :) I hope well!

My weekend has been pretty nice so far – I’ve been doing the job hunt this week, so working on that a bit over the weekend too. But I’ve also had some time to myself! I actually went to my first Bar Method class yesterday and signed up for a monthly pass. It kicked my butt!! But I’m looking forward to going more (and for it to get less painful hopefully *laughs*)

**Tutorial: Donuts & Chocolate Sprinkles**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base & top coat
– Nail polish in pink, brown, lavender, and tan/gold
- Dotting tools with a couple of different sizes (large for the donuts, small for the sprinkles)

Step 2: Prep it & paint it! I unfortunately forgot to take pictures at the beginning, but this is the easy part. Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat. Once that’s dried, paint on 2-3 coats of your pink polish to get a nice solid base color.

Step 3: Do(nu)t it! Now take your tan/gold polish and paint a variety of large circles on your nails. I did one full one on each nail, as well as two partial circles by the edges.

Step 4: Icing! Can’t have donuts without icing, now can we? Take your lilac and brown nail polishes and, using your dotting tool, paint smaller circles within your large tan/gold “donuts”.

(This would be a cool place to stop for some funky mod nails, huh? ;) )

Step 5: Hole it! (That felt weird to type… Lol) Finally, take your pink polish again and place small pink dots at the center of each of your donuts. Now you have some tasty donuts adorning your fingertips!

But donuts aren’t enough, wouldn’t you agree? I think we need some sprinkles to tie everything together! Take the smallest dotting tool you have, dip it in your brown polish, and make tiny lines all over your nails to create a backdrop of chocolate sprinkles!

Step 6: Finish it! Finally, clean up the edges, seal your manicure with a top coat, and voila! A tasty pastry manicure to lighten up your hands!

I actually just bought some donuts last night, rather fitting for this post don’t you think? Oh Krispy Kreme, you are so tasty and will so be the death of me *laughs*

So what’s going on with you all this week? Any fun plans? On my end it’s continued job hunting and… oh how could I forget this:

GAME OF THRONES FINALE TONIGHT!!

I know, I’m awful and didn’t do a Fandom Inspired post for GoT tonight :P But oh gosh I’m pumped! And also sad, because now we all have to wait about a year for the next season :( But Teen Wolf starts up again next week so that’s exciting ;)
