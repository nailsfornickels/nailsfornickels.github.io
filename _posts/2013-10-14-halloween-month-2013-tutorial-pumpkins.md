**Pumpkin Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Orange nail polish
- Green nail polish
- Nail polish in a neutral color (I did a khaki/beige)

Step 2: Prep and paint! Clean, buff, and style your nails in the manner you prefer, then paint them with the clear base coat. Once that has dried, paint your nails with your neutral base color.

Step 3: The pumpkins! Take out your orange polish. On the tip of your nail, paint from the side of the nail down to the tip in a gentle curve.

Repeat this same motion, but on the other side of the nail.

(Side note: the dip between the two curves should be more centered, I just messed up a little on this nail :P )

Step 4: Vine it! Now take your green polish and paint tiny stems on the curves of your pumpkins.

Step 5: Finish it! Seal your manicure with a top coat, clean up the edges, and there you have it! A fun and festive pumpkin manicure for all to see.

This manicure is nice because it is so simple. There is no need for any additional supplies; all you need is the nail polish!
