Hello my lovelies! Oh what a BEAUTIFUL morning we have here, it definitely feels like we’re into summer at this point. :)

This week I kept things a bit simple after the fandom tutorials I threw your way: just some black polish with gold sparkly tips and full gold polish on the ring fingers.

I love the look of this one! I really like the combination of black and gold; it’s very elegant and I think it’s PERFECT for a date/party night. ;)
