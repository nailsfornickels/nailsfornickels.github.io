Happy Monday, my fabulous and lovely readers! So I have some pretty gosh-darned exciting news:

I’M MOVING TO CALIFORNIA!!

My hubby and I have been planning this move for a while, but we’ve only recently finalized all of the details. Come Friday morning we’ll have the moving truck all packed and be making our way to the Bay Area. I’m so incredibly excited!

Now it’s been a little while since I’ve had a full-fledged tutorial for you all. And, of course, one of the things I’m most excited for in California is the sushi scene. And, thirdly, I watched the documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” a little while ago and it got me salivating. So let’s combine all three of these things into one super, California-and-great-documentaries-themed tutorial:

**Sushi Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! Okay, so there are a LOT of colors required for this manicure, but fortunately it’s all pretty easy! Just a bit time-consuming. ;)

For this manicure you will need:
-A small paint/makeup brush
-A small dotting tool
-A large dotting tool
-A piece of paper/plastic to drip paint on
-Clear base and top coat
-Lots of different nail polish colors! I’ll take you through each nail step by step, but no matter how you do your nails make SURE you have white polish for the sushi rice!

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails in the style you prefer, then paint them with the clear base coat.

And now I’m going to take you through each nail style, step-by-step, and then you can decide how you want to do your sushi manicure!

**Part 1: Fatty Tuna Nigiri Wrapped with Seaweed**

Step 1: Paint it! Paint your whole nail with the white polish.

Step 2: Paint it (again)! Paint one half of your tuna nail with a deep red polish. Try to paint it in a slight curve, to emulate a piece of fish draped across a bed of rice.

Step 3: Stripe it! Finally, paint a thick stripe of black across the middle of the nail. This is the piece of seaweed that holds the sushi together!

**Part 2: Salmon Nigiri**

Step 1: Paint it! Same as the tuna, paint the entire nail white.

Step 2: Paint half of the nail orange, again trying to curve the color.

Step 3: Line it! Now we’re going to make the lines of fat in slices of salmon. Take your paint/makeup brush, dip it in your white polish, and paint thin white lines through the orange half of your nail.

**Part 3: Octopus Nigiri Wrapped with Seaweed**

Step 1: Paint it! Same as the other two, start by painting your entire nail white.

Step 2: Paint it (again)! And, same as the other two, paint half of your nail with the second color. This time I used a deep maroon/plum.

Step 3: Dot it! To make the suction cups of the octopus, use a large dotting tool and place dots of a lighter pink/purple onto the color portion of the nail.

Step 4: Stripe it! And finally, just like the tuna nail, paint a thick black stripe across the center of the nail to act as the seaweed strip.

**Part 4: Rainbow Roll Side View**

Step 1: Paint it! Just like all the others, start with a white base for your nail.

Step 2: Paint the diagonal half of the nail with a pale pink polish (to symbolize a light fish, like white tuna or albacore).

Step 3: Paint it (again!) Take a light green polish and paint the upper half (at the edge of the nail) of the pink section. This is a slice of avocado that always tops a rainbow roll.

Whoops! I forgot to take a picture of this finished nail! But, as you’ll see in the final picture, you just finish up this nail by placing dots of random colors in the opposite corner of the nail. :)

**Part 5: Random Rice-Wrapped Sushi Roll**

Step 1: Paint it! You guessed it, start by painting the nail white!

Oh gosh, I forgot the intermediate photos for this nail too! But, essentially, you paint a large black dot in the center of the nail. You then paint a slightly smaller white dot in the center of the black dot. Paint small flecks of a light brown polish all over the nail (for sesame seeds!), and then paint small dots of color in the center of the black and white circle.

**Part 6: Multiple Sushi Rolls, Overhead View**

Step 1: Paint it! Finally, this one starts differently! Paint the entire nail black instead of white. ;)

Step 2: Dot it! Take your large dotting tool and between 2-3 large white dots across the black surface.

Step 6: Color it! Take as many different colors are you like, and place tiny dots of color in a cluster at the center of the white circles.

**Final Step For All:**

Seal your manicure with a clear top coat, and you’re done!

These nails are SO much fun – I can’t tell you how many compliments I got on these. :) Not only does it create a super cute manicure, but since there are so many different types of sushi this theme gives you a multitude of ways to show off your creativity.

Have an amazing week, my wonderful readers! And wish me luck as my husband and I prepare for this next stage in our lives. :)
