 Happy Thursday, my lovelies! And for all of my readers in the USA, Happy Thanksgiving!

 For this year, I mixed up four different glitter colors (red, orange, warm gold, and bright gold) to get a nice mosaic of the fall aesthetic!

 If you haven't done glitter nails before, they're super easy! All you need to do is paint on a base coat and, while it's still wet, sprinkle glitter. Then you seal it with a clear top coat! Check out my tutorial [here](/tutorial-glitter-tips/) for more details.

 Who has some fun plans for the day? Hubby and I are staying at home and getting some work done, BUT I'm making pumpking pie after this post goes up! Yum!
