Happy Sunday, my lovelies! And happy OFFICIAL start to the Christmas season! I’m absolutely one of those crazy people that put up her decorations the weekend after Halloween, but I wait until December for the nail art ;) Also, sorry about the late post! Hubby and I spent the day yesterday putting together our new bed from Ikea so I didn’t get to my nails until today.

Unfortunately the lighting in my apartment is REALLY crappy at night, so the quality of these photos isn’t that great. And I was rushed to finish the mani today so the edges are a bit messy. And basically I’m sorry the quality isn’t amazing but I hope you get the general idea! Lol.

I did the glitter tips method for this manicure. First I did a white base coat, and then once that dried I used hole reinforcement stickers to paint the tips of my nails. While the polish was still wet I sprinkled glitter on them and shook off the excess. Finally, I sealed the mani with clear top coat and cleaned up the edges. Check out of of my first tutorials here to see how you can do your own glitter nails.
