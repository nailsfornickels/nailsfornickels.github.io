Happy Sunday, my lovelies! And happy February! Is everyone having a nice start to the month so far? I learned a valuable lesson this morning – DON’T leave your plastic laundry detergent bottle on top of the dryer, because apparently the surface gets hot enough to melt the plastic and leak detergent everywhere! *laughs* So yeah, that’s been my morning ;)

Haven’t seen velvet nails in a while, huh? I absolutely love the set of flocking powder I have (seen here, though I bought it at Michael’s) – those subtle sparkles are so cute! And I love the way this pink pops – I don’t normally like pink polishes on myself, but I did really like the combination of pink polish and velvet.

Well that’s all from me today, lovelies! Sorry for the short post, but I need to go buy some more laundry detergent *laughs* Have a wonderful week and I’ll see you next time <3
