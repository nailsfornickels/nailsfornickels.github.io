Happy Sunday, my lovelies!

I have a very simple but very cool manicure to show you today! It was inspired by the lovely lady over at Pshiiit: http://pshiiit.com/2012/05/27/thesundaynailbattle-cannes-palme-et-talons-hauts/

(Unfortunately she took down the original picture because it involved a trademarked name, so I’ve named mine “Under Color” *laughs*)

So let’s get started, my lovelies!

**Tutorial: Under Color**

Step 1: Supplies!

This manicure couldn’t be easier! All you need is:

- Clear base & top coat
- Top polish color (black for me)
- Under polish color (red for me)
- Tape

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then apply your clear base coat.

Step 3: Tape it! Take a piece of tape and use it to sort of pull the pad of your finger tips down.

This allows you to get more of the nail painted while simultaneously preventing the finger pad from messing up the polish.

Step 4: Paint it! FIRST: Make sure that you have painted on the clear base coat under your nail as well as on top. You don’t want the under-polish to stain your nails!

Got it? Good. ;)

Take your under color and paint the exposed nail. Try to keep the coats of polish thin so that you don’t have any gloopiness at the crease of finger pad and nail.

Step 5: Paint it (again)! Now take your top color and paint your nails as you would normally, 2-3 coats to get a solid color.

Step 6: Finish it! Finally, seal your manicure with a clear top coat, remove the pieces of tape, and voila! A regular-looking manicure with a fun surprise of color underneath!

I hope you have a wonderful week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
