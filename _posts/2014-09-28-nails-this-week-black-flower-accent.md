Happy Sunday, my lovelies! Have you had a nice week this week? I have! I finished the first complete draft of my book “Thanatos” (sequel to my first book [“Death Wish”](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Wish-Lindsey-Menges-ebook/dp/B00GF4LTYQ)) which was a HUGE accomplishment – the last third of the book did NOT want to be written *laughs*

I also took my hubby on a surprise date yesterday: we went to Monterey and visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It was SO BEAUTIFUL! I was also very proud of myself because for years I had a huge fear of large fish (not sharks, large fish) so aquariums were off the table, but I did great yesterday! I only panicked a little at a particular one, and I argue that that fish was stupidly big enough to scare anybody. ;)

But yeah, it was beautiful! I also wanted to do something fun and new this weekend, because I start my new job tomorrow! I’m really nervous because it’s my first engineering job, but I know that I’ll be okay! The company seems awesome and so do my new coworkers, so I’m really excited for this :)

So as you can see, today’s nails are Black Flower Accents! To see how to do this type of manicure yourself, check out my Flower Accent Tutorial. It’s super simple and just so gosh darn pretty!

I’ve also noticed something – I seem to really like black tips on my nails. They just look so nice! *laughs*

What sort of nails do you like the best? Is there a color, style, or accent that you tend to default to? Let me know in the comments!

Well that’s all from me today – I’m going to go out and enjoy my last day of freedom (lol) before starting at my sweet new job tomorrow! Have a great week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
