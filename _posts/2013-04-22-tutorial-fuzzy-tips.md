Happy Monday my lovelies! Did you all have a wonderful weekend? I certainly hope so :)

This week, I’ll be showing you how to make fuzzy french tips on your nails. This technique is really similar to my earlier tutorial on Velvet Nails, but with a few added steps. Click that link to go to my Velvet Nails tutorial for more information on where you can get the supplies for this super fun manicure.

**Fuzzy Tips!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need-

- Clear base & top coat
- Nail polish
- Flocking powder (I chose to do a monochrome style, so both my polish and powder are a lovely mint green)
- A paint or makeup brush
- A rubber band (or tape)
- A piece of paper or plastic

Step 2: Prep it! Clean and shape your nails in whatever style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once the base coat has dried, paint on your nail polish. (Unlike the full velvet nails, you want this layer of polish to dry completely.)

[Side Note: For steps 4-6, you will do one nail at a time.]

[Side Note 2: As I said in step 3, wait until the polish on your nails is completely dry before continuing on to these steps. This ensures that the flocking powder will only stick to the tips, and not the entire nail.]

Step 4: Tip it! Take your rubber band or tape, and section off the tip of your nail.

Paint the sectioned-off part of your nail with the polish.

Step 5: Fuzz it! Hold your hand over the piece of paper/plastic, and sprinkle your flocking powder over the nail until the tip is completely fuzzy.

Step 6: Brush it! Shake off the excess powder, then clean off any remaining powder with your makeup or paint brush.

Step 7: Clean and repeat! Repeat steps 4-6 on each nail, then clean up the edges.
