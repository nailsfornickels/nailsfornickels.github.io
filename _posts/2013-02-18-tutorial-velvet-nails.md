Happy Monday everybody! Sorry that this post is up a little late, I am sick as a dog and not happy about it :( But to make up for it, I have a very exciting tutorial for you today. I’m going to show you how to do a nail trend that’s very hot right now:

**Velvet Nails!**

In order to do this manicure at home, you are going to need some stuff called flocking powder. Now unless you are into model trains or scrapbooking, it’s pretty likely that you don’t have any at home. But fear not! I have found a few places for you where you can buy the powder.

If you don’t mind waiting for it to be shipped to you, [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_8?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=flocking+powder&sprefix=flocking%2Caps%2C270) has a lot of nice and inexpensive flocking powder kits. But if you are impatient and want it NOW (like I did ;) ), most craft stores should have it in their scrapbooking section. I found an AWESOME 12-color pack by Martha Stewart at [Michaels](http://www.michaels.com/martha-stewart-crafts-glitter-flocking-powder-set/10203141.html) that ended up being really inexpensive with the coupon I had. Plus it has glitter in each color, so BONUS!

I think you are going to have a lot of fun with this manicure! I know that as soon as I did my nails, both my sister and sister-in-law immediately wanted me to do theirs. And they turned out pretty sweet!

So let’s get down to it!

**Velvet Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you are going to need

- Clear base coat
- Paper (for catching the excess powder)
- Small makeup or paint brushes (for clearing away the excess powder)
- Nail polish
- Flocking powder that matches the nail polish color (I did red for both)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean and buff your nails to look however you want, then paint on the clear base coat.

[Note: For steps 3-5, do ONE finger at a time. You have to work quickly to ensure the powder sticks correctly.]

Step 3: Paint it! After the base coat dries, get out your polish and paint on the first coat.

Step 4: Paint it again, then powder it! Once the first coat dries, paint on a second coat, making sure it’s nice and thick. Then IMMEDIATELY take the flocking powder and generously sprinkle it over your nail so it sticks while the polish is still wet. [Protip: I do this step over the piece of paper, so I can put any powder that falls off back in the container. Waste not, want not!]

Step 5: Tidy it! Once you have enough powder on your nail, shake off the excess. (I actually do this part twice to make sure all polish areas are covered) After that, take the small brush to dust off any powder that got on the edges of your fingers. (Use the larger brush to sweep up any powder that wasn’t caught by the paper.)

Step 6: Finish it! Repeat steps 3-5 on all nails, and clean up any messy edges with a q-tip or tiny brush dipped in nail polish remover.

Now I KNOW you’ll want to feel your nails immediately, but be patient! The polish is still drying underneath, so try to give it at least an hour before you start feeling the fuzzies. And I can guarantee from personal experience that once they’re dry, you won’t be able to stop feeling your nails!

This manicure is super easy and super fun! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
