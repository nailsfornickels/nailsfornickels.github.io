Hey everyone! Did you all have a fabulous New Year’s? Did you rock some awesome party nails? ;)

Well the holiday season is OFFICIALLY over (unless you’re a retailer and already stocking up on Valentine’s Day supplies :P ), so we’re going back to regular manicures this week.

Since we’ve had some relatively complicated nail tutorials the last few times, I thought I’d keep things simple. Today, I have your basic French tips that are also accented with a silver tape lining.

And remember, if you want a quick and easy way to do French tips, check out the tutorial I did here.

Enjoy everybody! See you next time! <3
