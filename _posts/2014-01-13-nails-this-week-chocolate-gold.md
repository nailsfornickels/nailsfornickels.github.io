Happy Monday, lovelies! Sorry this post is up late, I got sick yesterday and it’s bled over into today. :( But I hope all of you are feeling wonderful this morning!

I have a simpler post for you today, but I absolutely LOVE how it looks: Chocolate & Gold!

This manicure is (obviously) really simple: just 2-3 coats of a brown-ish polish, then put on a strip of gold striping tape where you would have the edge of a French tip manicure.

Nice and simple, but also nice and elegant. My favorite kind! ;)
