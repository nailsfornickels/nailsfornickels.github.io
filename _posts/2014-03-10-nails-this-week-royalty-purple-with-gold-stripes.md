Happy Monday, my lovelies! How was your weekend? Did you get up to anything exciting? Let me know in the comments below!

Today’s manicure is pretty simple – I was originally planning to do a Mardi Gras-esque theme, but I ended up being too busy to do anything other than this purple and gold theme.

But I like how it turned out! The camera wasn’t able to capture how truly PURPLE this polish is. It’s a very deep, royal purple and I love it! Though I think the blue-ish purple in the photos looks cool too. :)

(Ack! Ignore the chip!)

So as you can see, all this manicure required was a few coats of purple polish, three strips of gold striping tape on each nail, and sealed with a top coat. If you don’t have any striping tape of your own, you can buy some here. (Look at all those pretty colors!)
