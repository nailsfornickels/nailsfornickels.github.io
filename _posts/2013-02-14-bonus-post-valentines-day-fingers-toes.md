Happy Valentine’s Day everybody!

I thought I’d throw in a short bonus post today, and show you what my nails look like today :)

**Pedicure:**

For my toes, I’ve done a red base with large white spots, bordered by a cluster of three tiny pink dots.

**Manicure:**

For my fingers, I did standard white French tips with red striping tape directly underneath. :)

Hope everyone has a great Valentine’s Day! See you Monday! <3
