Happy Monday everybody!

I’m keeping things simple this week, and doing a “Nails This Week” post instead of a tutorial. But fear not! I’ve got some awesome stuff coming up; I went to Michaels last week and got some very fun things, so expect awesome tutorials in the near future ;)

This week, I did an ombre manicure with some AWESOME purple & pink polishes I got last week :) To see how you can do this at home, check out my ombre tutorial here.

Have a great week everyone! See you next time! <3

**Nail polishes used:**

- Sinful Colors Professional in “24/7″ (#920)
- Sinful Colors Professional in “Let’s Talk” (#929)
