Wait for the base coat to dry before moving on to Step 3.

Step 3: Grape it! Take out your purple polish and drip a small amount onto the piece of paper/plastic.

Then, using your dotting tool, dot a pyramid-shaped cluster of purple dots on the center of your nail. This will be the “grape cluster”.

Then, using your toothpick, draw small “Y” shapes on the top of each grape cluster. This is the “vine” of the grapes.
