Happy Monday, my wonderful readers! And happy November!

Did everyone have a wonderful Halloween and a wonderful weekend? As you probably noticed I’ve been pretty busy with my book stuff, so my weekend consisted of that and of packing up the apartment to move in a few days.

Now I actually made this tutorial a while ago and wanted to release it when the new Pokemon games came out (X & Y), but since they released in October I wasn’t able to put up the tutorial (too busy with Halloween-themed manicures! ;) )

So let’s get started with some very awesome

**Fandom Inspired: “Pokemon” Pokeballs**

I would like to thank the ever-fabulous Bethany for modeling today’s manicure :)

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat (which I forgot in the picture, whoops!)
- Nail polish in red, white, and black
- A small paintbrush or toothpick
- A piece of paper/plastic
- Hole reinforcement stickers

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff and style your nails in the manner you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Take out your red and white polishes. Paint the top half of your nails red, and the bottom half white.
SIDE NOTE: I am a total moron, and forgot that Pokeballs are half white and half red until I got to the last step. :P So in the pictures the nails are all red, but if you want to save yourself a huge headache from meticulously painting the lower half of the manicure white, make them half red and half white in this step. ;)

Step 4: Sticker it! Once your polish is COMPLETELY dried (it’s dry when you can rub your nails against each other without feeling any tack), place hold reinforcement stickers on your nail and paint the inside circle black.

Remove the stickers to reveal the black circle.

Step 5: Line it! Drip some black polish onto your piece of paper/plastic and, using your small paintbrush/toothpick, draw two horizontal lines on either side of the black circles. This is the “seam” in the Pokeballs.

Step 6: Dot it! Now take out your white polish and, using either the built-in brush or your own dotting tool, paint a white dot inside the center of the black dot.

Step 7: (REMINDER! The bottom half of your pokeballs should be white!) Seal your manicure with a top coat, clean up the edges, and voila! You now have some fierce Pokeball-themed nails to rock while you’re out collecting badges. ;)

Because if you’re going to be the very best, it doesn’t hurt to look your very best!
