Happy Sunday, my lovelies! WOW my week has been intense – I just finished up my first week at DevBootCamp (my hacker school where I’m learning programming) and I am EXHAUSTED. It’s going well – I’m learning a lot and I know that this will all be so worth it, but I’m definitely excited to have a less crazy schedule in eight weeks ;) So I didn’t get a chance to redo my nails until yesterday, but I am VERY happy with what I made.

Any guesses as to what they are? Come on, what fandom is going crazy right now because of something happening tonight? Assuming you didn’t look at the title of this post, I’m going to go ahead and tell you:

*shrieks* GAME OF THRONES SEASON FOUR PREMIERS TONIGHT!!!!!

And BOY are some crazy things going to happen! If you haven’t read the books, trust me – you’re in for a wild ride this season ;)

So let’s get started with this manicure, which follows the theme of violence and mayhem in GoT/ASoIaF while still looking cute:

**Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice And Fire: Bloody Crowns**

(Whoops! Pardon the chip, please!)

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- A neutral nail polish for the base color (I chose a light tan/beige)
- Gold nail polish
- Green nail polish (or a jewel tone of your choice)
- Red nail polish
- A black sharpie OR black nail polish
- A dotting tool
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip paint on
- Scotch tape (to minimize cleanup when you’re splattering)
- A short piece cut off from a plastic straw (about 1.5 inches)

Step 2: Prep and paint! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat. Once that’s dried, paint your nails with about 2 coats of the neutral nail polish.

Step 3: Tip it! Paint the tips of your nails with gold nail polish. I like using hole reinforcement stickers for this (as seen here), but you can also use rubber bands (seen here), or just freehand it if you’re good at French tips.

Step 4: Crown it! Now we’re going to take the built-in polish brush (or you can use a small paintbrush if you prefer) and paint peaks into the gold tips.

Once you have your peaks done, you’re going to take your dotting tool and place large dots at the tip of each peak. If you don’t own dotting tools, my tutorial here shows you one way to make your own. You can also just use the polish’s brush to make a dot.

Step 5: Outline it! Take your sharpie or black polish with thin brush and outline the golden crowns.

You can skip this step if you like, but I HIGHLY recommend doing it. Once you’ve splattered on the red it’s tough to distinguish the shape of the crown, but outlining it in black really defines the crowns.

Step 6: Jewel it! Take your jewel color (emerald for me!) and your dotting tool and paint small dots at the center of each round peak of the crowns.

Step 7: Splatter that blood! Now comes the FUN part, splattering on the blood! ;) If you don’t know how to do splatter paint for nail art, check out one of my other fandom inspired tutorials: [Dexter Blood Spatter](http://nailsfornickels.com/fandom-inspired-dexter-blood-spatter/).

Wrap the edges of your nails with scotch tape so you don’t have to clean them up later, and drip some of your red polish onto the piece of paper/plastic.

Dip the straw into the red polish so that there’s a thin film of red across the opening of the straw. Place your lips on the other end of the straw and, in a short, quick burst, blow through the straw onto your nails.

Peel off the tape once you’ve splattered your nails to reveal the pretty, clean edges of your nails.

Step 8: Finish it! Seal your manicure with a clear top coat, clean up the edges of your nails, and voila! Some AWESOME bloody crowns on your fingers to celebrate the season 4 premiere of Game of Thrones. I’m so pumped for tonight!

Hubby and I are planning to marathon season 3 today, and I’m glad we’re doing that – I’m blanking on a lot of what happened last season! I always like doing refreshers before the new season of a show I love premiers. :) Anyone else watching the premiere tonight? Who else is a fellow GoT fan?? Let me know in the comments below :)
