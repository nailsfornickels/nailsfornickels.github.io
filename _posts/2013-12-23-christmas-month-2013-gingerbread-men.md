Happy Monday, my lovely readers! And for those to celebrate it, a very Merry Christmas to you all! We’re finishing up our Christmas Month 2013 this week, and I’m very happy with this week’s tutorial. I think we’re going out with a bang! ;) So without further ado, let’s get started and I can show you how to do:

**Gingerbread Men**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Neutral nail polish for the background (I did a white and silver ombre, but you do whatever you darn well please!)
- Nail polish in brown, red, and white
- A large and small dotting tool
- A toothpick
- A makeup sponge (if you plan to do an ombre background)
- A piece of paper/plastic for dripping paint on

(Sidenote: Do you like my candle in the back? It’s blueberry pumpkin patch, yum!)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Take out your neutral background color and paint your nails.

Step 4: Ombre!
(Sidenote: If you aren’t planning on doing an ombre background, go ahead and skip to step 5 :) )
Take your two ombre colors (for me, white and silver), and place two spots of the colors, side by side, on your piece of paper. Dab your makeup sponge in the dots, and press the wet sponge to your nails. Dab in an up and down motion a few time for each nail to get a nice ombre effect.

Step 5: Dot it! Now we’re done with the background and moving on to the gingerbread men themselves. For this first step, drip some of your brown polish onto your piece of paper/plastic. Then, using your large dotting tool, place large brown dots near the base of each of your nails.

Step 6: X marks the spot! Now, using the brush from your brown nail polish, paint an “X” below the “head” of each of your gingerbread men. You can fill in a “neck” with the polish, but the red bow ties that we’ll be doing later will also cover the blank spot. :)

Step 7: The face and cuffs! Now drip some of your white polish onto your piece of paper/plastic. Use the small dotting tool to dot two small “eyes” onto the gingerbread person’s “face”.

Then, using the toothpick, draw a tiny smile onto that face. Use the toothpick again to draw little lines on his “arms” and “legs”.

Step 8: The finishing touches! We’re almost there! Now take out your red polish, drip some onto your piece of paper/plastic, and get ready. Use your toothpick to draw a tiny bow tie around his neck, and use your small dotting tool to give him a couple of buttons.

Step 9: *Mortal Kombat voice* Finish him! Give your mani a few minutes to air dry, and then seal your work with the clear top coat. Clean up the edges and tada! You have some too-cute cookies on your nails to celebrate the last of this year’s Christmas season.

I hope you’ve all enjoyed my Christmas manis for the month of December. I know that I’ve loved doing them!
