Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How's everyone doing today? Did you have a nice Valentine's day? I can't believe we're already past the halfway mark of February!

Keeping things cute and simple this week, and when I want cute and simple I always default to something sparkly!

Originally, when I started these nails, I was setting out to do a silver-to-black ombre. But when I did the ombre the contrast wasn't quite as dramatic as I was expecting it to be. So I decided to switch it up! I grabbed my bottle of silver sparkles and dotted it over the silver portion of the gradient to increase the silver contract.

After the glitter was added and dried, I broke out the nail glue and some of my decorations and threw on three stars to each of my middle fingers. This experience just goes to show you that changing your plans can result in something awesome!

(That sounds deeper than anticipated for a fun weekend nail post *laughs*)

That's all from me, my lovelies! If you've got a three day weekend (my USA readers) then I hope you enjoy it! And everyone have a lovely week this week! <3
