Happy Monday, my lovelies! Hey I’m getting this post out a bit early today, hooray for a semi-consistent sleep schedule. ;) Haha. Did you all have a nice weekend? I hope so!

This week I FINALLY have another tutorial for you:

**Caviar Nails!**

Now there are a couple of ways to do this 3-D style manicure: you can always purchase a kit made specifically for caviar nails like this one here, and it will have everything you need. But you know me, I like the DIY, cheaper options. ;)

So I (of course) went to Michael’s, and found a GREAT set of microbeads in their scrapbooking section. If you would prefer to put together the items for a caviar manicure yourself, look for microbeads! There are great options both online as well as in craft stores. Now on to the tutorial!

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base coat
- Microbeads in the color of your choosing
- A small bowl/dish (to pour the beads into)
- A small paint or makeup brush

Step 2: Prep it! After filing and buffing your nails in the manner you prefer, paint on the base coat.

(Sidenote: I have you put on the first base coat to give your nails an extra layer of protection. These 3-D style manicures can be rough on your nails [especially if you’re doing them on your natural nails], so I always recommend  putting on that extra layer of protection.)

Step 3: Get the beads ready! Pour your beads into the small bowl or dish to use in the next step.

(Sidenote: For steps 4 & 5, do each nail one at a time so the base coat doesn’t dry before you can put on the beads.)

 Step 4: Paint it! Once your initial base coat dries, paint on another base coat.

Step 5: Dip it! Immediately after painting your nail with the clear coat, dip your fingernail into the bowl/dish of microbeads. Move your finger from side to side if necessary to ensure that you get full coverage of the beads on your nail.

Step 6: Brush it! Take your small paint/makeup brush, and lightly brush the surface of your nail to remove any loose beads.

Step 7: Finish it! Be sure to WAIT until the clear polish has dried to clean up the edges of your manicure. If the polish is still wet, you may move the beads around and ruin the look of the manicure. (Speaking from experience ;) ) I also threw on another clear top coat to seal in the manicure, but that step is optional. If anyone does it without a top coat, could you tell me how long your manicure lasted? With the top coat, mine lasted about 5-7 days, with the chipping beginning around day 4.

And there you have it! Easier than it looks, huh?
