Happy Monday, my lovelies!

Oh my goodness, it looks like this week is shaping up to be a cold one across the U.S.. I hope, no matter where you are located, that you’re staying nice and warm! And to do my part, how about I show you how to do your nails in a spring and summertime fashion? Warm-looking nails leads to warm thoughts, after all. ;) So let’s get started with:

**Tutorial: Daisies**

Step 1: Supplies! For this simple manicure, you will need:

- A small dotting tool
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on
- Clear base and top coat
- Light blue nail polish
- White nail polish
- Yellow nail polish

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on a clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once the base coat has dried, paint your nails with 2-3 coats of the blue polish to get a nice, solid background color.

Step 4: Dot it! Drip some of your yellow polish onto the paper/plastic and, using your small dotting tool, dot a few yellow points (with plenty of space in between) across your nails.

I did four daisies on my thumbs, three on my index, middle, and ring fingers, and two on my pinkies. But you do as many as your darn well please. :)

Step 5: Dot it (again)! Now drip some white polish onto your paper/plastic and, using the small dotting tool again, place a series of white dots around the edges of your yellow dots. For reference, I did five white dots around each yellow dot, but your number may depend on the size of your dotting tool and your nails.

Step 6: Finish them! Seal your manicure with a top coat once the polish dries, clean up the edges, and voila! A cute springtime manicure to help chase away those winter blues.

I hope you all had a wonderful weekend! And hey, happy Groundhog day, before I forget! Bummer about the six more weeks of winter – let’s hope they’re sunny ones haha. ;)
