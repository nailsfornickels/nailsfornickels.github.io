Happy Sunday, my lovelies!

So guess what? I GRADUATED!! Friday was the last day of my hacker school program, DevBootCamp :) I don’t think it’s sunk in yet – my life basically revolved around the program, and now it’s time to go back into the real world. I’m unemployed without an excuse, so now the job hunt commences! ;)

I’m soooo excited, I’ll actually get to do my nails this weekend! But I didn’t get a chance to yesterday, so today’s post comes from a couple of weeks ago. We had some lovely sunny days here in the Bay, so I thought a nautical-themed manicure was the way to go. So without further ado, let’s learn how to make:

**Nautical Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Royal/cobalt blue nail polish
- Gold nail polish
- Gold striping tape
- Cuticle nippers
- A thin paintbrush
- A small dotting tool

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then put on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Take your blue polish and paint your nails with a couple of coats (enough to get a solid base color).

Step 4: Anchors! Now we get to paint on our anchors! First things first, take your thin paintbrush and gold polish then paint a small vertical stripe on your nail.

Next, paint a curved line at the base of vertical stripe. Paint two arrows at each end of the curve and paint a small horizontal stripe towards the top of the vertical stripe.

Now take your dotting tool and paint three gold dots on each of the open stripe ends.

Finally, take your dotting tool and paint a slightly smaller blue dot in the center of your large gold circle.

Tada! Turns out painting anchors is pretty easy ;)

Step 5: Stripe it! Now take your striping tape and, on the fingers where you didn’t paint anchors, place three horizontal gold stripes across the blue.

Step 6: Finish it! Now seal your manicure with a top coat, clean up the edges and voila! A summer-tastic, nautical themed manicure for you to rock on the water or on the land. ;)

Oh! I forgot to mention this, but I was mentioned in a Buzzfeed article yesterday! My rubber band French tips tutorial is number 15 on the list of [“27 Everyday Objects That Went Beyond The Call of Duty”](http://www.buzzfeed.com/alannaokun/everyday-objects-that-went-beyond-the-call-of-duty#.meeYANAP4). How exciting! I’m so pumped! (I’m also really happy that they linked back to me lol ;) )
