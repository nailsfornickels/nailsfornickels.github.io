Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you all doing today? For my American readers, are you ready for Thanksgiving this week? :) This is hubby’s and my first year out in California and we’ll be staying out here for the holiday (but we’ve got a big trip planned back to Colorado for Christmas). We both get time off of work, however, so we’re making plans for the long weekend :) For my California readers, any suggestions? I’d love to hear them!

So here’s the big question: HAVE YOU SEEN MOCKINGJAY PART 1 YET?? We saw it Friday night, and it was GREAT. I will admit that it was slower than Catching Fire, but that’s also true in the book. They had the slower, world-building part of the book to work with for the movie, and I think that they did an AWESOME job. I also really don’t want to wait another year for the final movie! *sobs* Well, it’ll be great when it comes out :) So if you haven’t seen Mockingjay Part 1 yet and you like the movies, go see it post haste!

**Fandom Inspired: “The Hunger Games – Mockingjay” Capitol Nails**

OBVIOUSLY when a big fandom event happens, I have to do some fandom nails for it! These ones are a bit different though: for these nails, I stuck with the idea of Capitol nails (lots of colors, glitter, and glitz!) and gave them the coloring of the “Mockingjay” book cover.

So as you can see, these are similar to the [“Catching Fire” fandom nails](http://nailsfornickels.com/fandom-inspired-hunger-games-catching-fire-katniss-capitol-fire-nails/) I did last year for the movie premiere. I used tape to get the multicolored tips – check out my tutorials [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-tri-colored-points/) and [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-triple-blue-tips/) if you’d like to do this style yourself. I love doing this style: it’s such a fun twist on the classic French tip!

I used sky blue, white, and silver for the nail polish (as blue, white, and gray are abundant on the book cover), and then threw silver and blue jewels on either side of the silver section to give it that hint of Capitol decadence ;)

Well, that’s all from me, my lovelies! I really hope you enjoyed today’s post, and I hope everyone has an AMAZING week this week. Stay safe over the holidays, if you’re working I hope it goes well, and everyone have a great week this week! I’ll see you next time <3
