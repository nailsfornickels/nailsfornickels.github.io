Happy Monday my lovelies! Did you all have a wonderful weekend? I certainly did, the weather was GORGEOUS! And, of course, it’s supposed to snow again on Wednesday… I’m bored with you now, Winter ;)

This manicure was super simple! All I had to do was paint my nails half black and half white, and then once the polish dried I put a couple of strips of purple striping tape across the center. I liked the pop the tape gave this otherwise colorless manicure :)

(Side note: Holy COW I didn’t realize how long my ring-finger nail was until I took the picture! Haha)

Have a fabulous day my wonderful readers! See you next time! <3
