Gooooooooooood morning, my lovely readers! Happy Monday! I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. :)

With summer slowly winding down and fall on the horizon (Yay! Fall is my favorite <3), I thought we should do a few more summery fruit nails to celebrate the last bit of summer we have left! And with that, let’s get started on how to do your own

**Kiwi Slice Nails!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in green, white, black, and tan/brown
- A toothpick
- Hole reinforcement stickers
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint your entire nail with 2-3 coats of the green polish (enough to get a good base color).

Then WAIT until the green polish is completely dry before moving on to step 4. :)

Step 4: Stick it! Take one of the hole reinforcement stickers and place it on your nail so that there is an uncovered sliver at the tip of your nail and the center hole of the sticker is at the center of your nail.

(Side note: Depending on how large your nails are, you may get a brown ring around the entire “slice” instead of just the tip. Either way looks fine. When I did this manicure I got a ring on my thumbs and just the sliver on the rest of my fingers.)

Step 5: Paint it! Grab your tan/brown polish and your white polish. Paint the outer edge(s) of the sticker brown, and paint the inner circle white.

Remove the sticker.

Step 6: Seed it! Now drip some of the black polish onto your piece of paper/plastic, take out your toothpick, and paint small black “seeds” around the center white circle.

Step 7: Finish it! Seal your manicure with the clear top coat, clean up the edges, and you’re done.
