Hello my lovelies! Happy Monday! Did you all have a nice weekend? Any fun plans for the week? My hubby’s and my 2 year anniversary is on Wednesday, so I’m super stoked for that! (We’re getting mani-pedis done together, shhhh don’t tell my blog ;) )

Yesterday I realized that, since we’re in August officially, summer is drawing to a close! Soon school will be starting, the weather will be cooling down, and it’ll be back to the old grind for a lot of my readers. So I thought we should celebrate the last days of summer with a few more summer-themed tutorials! So let’s go and I’ll show you how to make

**Snowcone Nails!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- White nail polish
- Tape
- A small paint/makeup brush
- Glitter in your choice of colors (I did red, purple, green, orange, and blue)
- Pieces of paper/sticky notes to catch excess glitter (which I forgot to put in the photo! Whoops!)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and style your nails in the manner you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Tape it! Once your base coat has dried, grab your tape. Take two pieces of the tape and place them over your nail in a “V” shape. This will be the “paper cone” of your “snowcones” ;)

(Check out my “Chevron Nails” tutorial here to see an easy method for making the tape “V”)

Step 4: Paint it! Once your tape is in place, take your your white polish and paint inside the “V” of the tape.

Peel away the tape to reveal the cone underneath.

Wait until the white polish is dry before moving on.

Step 5: Paint and glitter! Take your clear coat and paint just the top edge of your “paper cone”. Then, holding your finger over the piece of paper to catch any excess, sprinkle the glitter onto the clear coat tip. Use your makeup brush to clear away any excess specks.

Step 6: Finish it! After doing all of your nails, brush away excess glitter and seal your manicure with a top coat. Clean up the edges of your nails and voila! Some delicious and sparkly snow cone nails that you’ll want to gobble up on these final hot days of summer. :)
