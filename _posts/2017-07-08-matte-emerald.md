Happy Saturday, my lovelies!

We are in the full swing of summer, huh? How crazy hot has it been for you all? We've had a few roller coaster weeks in the past couple of months: it got STUPID hot, and then it got a little cool, then it got a little warm, and now we're into decently warm but not quite stupid hot ;)

My nails this week are in more cool, muted colors - maybe it's my subconscious trying to trick my body into cooling down! I used a matte top coat instead of a standard gloss coat, and the results are gorgeous!

I love how elegant matte top coats can make a manicure. Adding this one simple finishing touch to your nails can transform them into a completely different look! "Sleek" is definitely the word I would use for this effect.

But you know me - I can't be completely without a bit of sparkle or pop when it comes to my nails! So after I painted my nails and added the matte coat, I used some nail glue to adhere some small gold diamond embellishments. Another thing I love with nail art is contrasts, and the combo of sleek and sparkle is A+++ in my book!

Short and sweet this week, my lovelies! I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and I'll see you next time! <3
