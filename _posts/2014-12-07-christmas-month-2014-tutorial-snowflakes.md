Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How is everyone doing on this lovely morning? Have you been having a nice weekend? Friday night my company had their holiday party so hubby and I went to that – it was a lot of fun! Engineers know how to party ;) And then yesterday was spent tidying up the apartment (I have NO IDEA how it gets dirty when we both work full time??), ordering some Christmas presents online, and general relaxing. For those of you that celebrate Christmas, have you gotten started on your shopping? We’re hoping to go out and do some more today. I would say what I’ve been getting people, but I know they read this blog ;) *laughs*

So today we are, of course, continuing with the Christmas month nails! Now, as it’s December and the weather has been alternating between rainy and sunny/pleasant, I’ve been missing something from Colorado. So to give me a little slice of my home state and to continue staying in the Christmas spirit, I present to you:

**Christmas Month 2014 Tutorial: Snowflakes**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in your preferred base and snowflake colors (I chose blue and white respectively for mine)
- A large dotting tool and a small dotting tool
- If desired, a piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on (I frequently just press the dotting tool to the brush of the polish, but the polish can be easier to manage if it’s on a separate surface)

(I’m really sorry, I forgot to take a picture of the supplies!)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Base color! Once the base coat has dried, paint on 2-3 coats of your base color polish – enough to get a solid background for your snowflakes.

Step 4: Line it! Now take your snowflake color polish and your small dotting tool (You can also use a thin nail art/makeup brush) and paint a ‘+’ sign on your nail.

Reapply polish to your tool and paint a smaller ‘X’ over the ‘+’.

Step 5: Dot it! Now take your LARGE dotting tool, apply some more polish, and place a large dot at each end of the two longer ‘+’ lines.

Step 6: Finish it! Finally, seal your manicure with a clear top coat once the polish has dried, clean up the edges, and voila! Some winter wonderland-y nails for you to rock this season. :)

BONUS: I actually FIRST attempted to do this manicure with glitter snowflakes! Unfortunately I only got the first glitter-flake to look the way I wanted (and my desk now has gold glitter EVERYWHERE), so I ended up redoing my manicure using regular old nail polish. But I thought you’d enjoy seeing a sparkly snowflake! And don’t worry if your manicures don’t always come out perfect! I’ve been doing nail art for a couple of years now, and I still mess up plenty of times. The important thing is to give it a try, have fun, and love the nails you create <3

So like I said, I’ve got some more Christmas shopping to get to! How about you all? And are the decorations up yet? We definitely put ours up right after Halloween *laughs*

So what do you think of today’s design? I love how these turned out! Oh and if you’re wondering what’s up with the crack/ridge on my index finger in ^ this picture: at some point during my drunken escapades Friday night *laughs* I managed to whack off half of the polish on that finger. I did a quick patch job yesterday, but there is a ridge that I can’t help but keep running my fingers over lol.

So what winter-y or Christmas-themed nails are you sporting this season? And if you don’t have any on yourself, what are some styles you really like? Let me know in the comments or tweet me!

I’m quite excited – I’ve got work for two more weeks and then I’m going on vacation to see family for Christmas! I really hope that it snows while we’re there. I crave cold weather this time of year, but I think once I get a taste then I’ll be good until next year *laughs*

That’s all from me, my lovelies! Have a great week and I’ll see you next time <3
