Happy Monday, my lovely readers! How are you doing this week? Did you have a nice weekend?

My weekend consisted of nothing but moving – a 27 hour drive from Denver to San Jose, unloading the truck, and getting our new place organized and unpacked. And my nails are TRASHED! Fortunately, I have backup posts for just such an occasion. ;) So how about we check out one of them with today’s post:

(Side note: I apologize for the air bubbles – I was in a rush when I did them and didn’t have time to redo :( )

Doing your nails like this is extremely easy! Just make a french tip in the color and style you prefer (for a straight tip, I recommend the rubber band method, and for the curved tip I like to use hole reinforcement stickers) and then line the edge with decorative jewels / pearls / studs of your choice.

Well I have to get back to unpacking and organizing – but I’m hopeful today’s the last day of that. ;)
