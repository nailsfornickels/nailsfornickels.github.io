Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you all doing on this lovely day? Doesn’t today mark the official start of fall? Yay! Except you wouldn’t know it where I live… *laughs* That’s definitely something I’m still getting used to with California – consistent weather! I’m really happy that I’ll be going back out to Denver for Christmas though, I hope it’ll snow while I’m out there :) Need my fix!

So today’s manicure is inspired from these nails I saw from The Illustrated Nail (on the left side). Aren’t those all so gorgeous? Seeing such talented nail artists is always inspiring – I only hope I can reach that level someday! But as soon as I saw the silver and mint ones I thought “Oooo, I can give that a try!” And I am very happy with the results.

Doing this style was very simple. I did a solid base color in the light teal/mint, and once that dried I painted on the sparkles, adding more to the tip of the nail to give it that gradient/waterfall look. And finally, I used my hole reinforcement sticker technique to paint on French tips in the black.

This upcoming week is my last week before I start my new job, so exciting! I’ve been working hard on Thanatos, which is the sequel to my book Death Wish, and I’m hoping that I can have the first draft finished before I start work. The book will still have a LOT more work to be done with revisions, but getting that first draft complete is always a huge milestone. There’s also another project I’m working on, but that’s a little hush hush at the moment ;)

Well that’s all from me, my lovelies! I hope you have a great rest of your week! I’ll see you next time <3
