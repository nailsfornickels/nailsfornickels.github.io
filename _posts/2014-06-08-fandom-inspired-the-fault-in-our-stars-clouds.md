Happy Sunday, my lovelies!

So. I saw “The Fault In Our Stars” yesterday.

OH. MY GOSH. IT WAS SO GOOOOOOOOOD.

I loved the book (John Green is an AMAZING author, this is a known fact) and, to be honest, I wasn’t expecting much from yet another summer book-to-movie release. But OH my goodness, it was so clear that everyone involved in the film really cared about the source material. The film was amazing, so if you haven’t already do yourself a favor and please go see it!

My nails for the movie were pretty simple – just the black and white clouds from the cover of the book! If you want to know how to do cloud nails at home, just check out my easy-peasy tutorial here!

So what do you all have going on for this lovely week in June? Any summer vacations planned? I would love to hear some deets, my dears!

On my end, the job hunt begins this week! I have my LinkedIn all filled out and my resume pretty and polished, now let’s hope that the process goes well. Kind thoughts and prayers would be greatly appreciated! I’m pretty darn nervous, but hey, who knows what the future holds! I’m doing my best to turn uncertainty into excitement :)

Have a great week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
