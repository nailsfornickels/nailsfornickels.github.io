Happy Sunday, my lovelies! Did everyone have a nice post-holiday week? I did! Went back to work after a two week break and was ecstatic to find that I hadn’t forgotten everything ;) *laughs*

Today’s nails are pretty simple: a smokey ombre! I’ve been missing ombre nails (they are one of my favorite types of nail art), and I really like this color combination. The light tan almost makes it look like the tips of your fingers are morphing into claws! Which I like lol.
