Hello my lovelies! This week’s post is a couple of days early, because guess what?

I’M GOING TO ANIME EXPO!!!

It was a total last minute decision – I found out that the con was this weekend, told hubby about it, then we bought our badges and hotel reservations yesterday! Oh my goodness I am so excited: the only anime convention I’ve been to was two NDKs (Nan Desu Kan) in Denver when I was in high school. So this is my first BIG con, and hubby’s first – we couldn’t be more pumped!

Plus this will be my first time in L.A., I’m excited! We’re going to try to split our time between the con and checking out neat things in downtown L.A. Our hotel is near the convention center, so if any of my readers are from the area and have some tips on fun things to do, please let me know! :)

So anyway, onto this week’s nails:

SAILOR MOON CRYSTAL PREMIERS THIS SATURDAY!!!!! *shrieks* I am so so SO excited! Like most people around my age, Sailor Moon was my first introduction to anime and it holds a very special place in my heart. (P.S. the cast is going to be at AX and they’re going to be doing a screening, eeeeee! *squeals*) So OBVIOUSLY I had to do something Sailor Moon-themed this week!

But what to do? Doing mini portraits of each of the Scouts? That’s beyond my abilities *laughs* Color coding? Meh, that’s a little boring. And then it hit me: The Senshi astrological symbols!

For each of my nails, I did two things: First, I painted the nail with the main color (i.e. skirt and collar) of the uniform. Then I placed a small curve of faux crystals (for Sailor Moon Crystal, get it?? Lol) at the nail base in the color of the scout’s secondary color (i.e. their ribbon/bow color). Finally, I used gold polish to paint the symbols of each of the girls: Crescent moons on my thumbs for Serena, and the astrological symbols on each of my other fingers for the other eight scouts. (I forgot to make a Chibi-Usagi specific one, but since she’s the next Moon Princess I figured two moons is close enough ;) )

Out of curiosity, who is your favorite Sailor Scout? Mine is Jupiter!! Kino Makoto is my girl, no question <3 But I love all of the senshi so much! Pluto / Setsuna is my second favorite :)

So as I’ve said, I’m gonna be at Anime Expo this weekend! If you happen to see me wandering around, please come say hi! I’m planning to wear this shirt and either shorts or capris:
