Hello my lovelies, and happy Earth Day!

The California weather has been clearing up: we had a week of GORGEOUS sunshine, but then lots of rain and clouds this last week! But the good news is that, with this crazy wet winter, northern California has been drought free for a while now! Hooray!

Grateful as I am for the moisture, though, I am SUPER ready for it to get sunny again! I miss my outside time! (Although my allergies have been kicking my butt with the super bloom everywhere ;P )

Speaking of the outdoors: since today is Earth Day, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to show you how to do some fuzzy dandelion nails! So let's get started:

# **Tutorial: Dandelions**

Step 1: Supplies! For these nails you will need:

- Clear base & top coat
- Nail polish in green, blue, and black (any shades you want: these will be the grass, sky, and stems/leaves)
- White flocking powder
- A thin brush
- A fan or other gentle brush for sweeping away excess powder
- A piece of paper/plastic for catching excess powder

Step 2: Prep! Trim, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Sky! Take your blue polish and paint 1-2 coats on your nails (enough to get a solid color).

Step 4: Grass! Once the blue polish is dry, take your green polish and paint the lower half (near the tip) of your nails to create the grassy hill.

Step 5: Stem! After the green polish dries take your thin brush (a toothpick or small dotting tool will also work) and paint a thin vertical line with your stem color halfway along your nail, leaving empty space at the base and tip.

Step 6: Leaves! Using the same color and your thin brush, create a little 'v' at the base of the stem (on the grassy side of the nail). I made these shapes a little sketchy to emulate the curved & sharp silhouette of dandelion leaves.

Step 6.5: WAIT! Wait for the polish to dry, paint on your top coat, and wait until your nails are *completely* dry before moving on to the next step. Flocking powder stick to anything wet, so you want yours nails totally dry to ensure the only fuzzy parts are your flower puffs!

Step 7: Fuzz! Now here's the fun part: making the puff at the top of your flowers! If you've never worked with flocking powder before, check out my velvet nails tutorial [here](/tutorial-velvet-nails/).

Take one of your clear polishes (I used my base coat because my top coat is quick-dry) and drop a dot of clear polish at the top of your stems. Sprinkle the flocking powder over the wet polish.

Give the powder 15-30 seconds to set (be sure to sprinkle it all over in a solid layer to ensure full coverage), and then tap your finger upside down to get rid of the excess. You can also use your fan brush to sweep away the remains around the puff.

Step 8: Done! Clean up the edges of your nails and you're done!

Today was a bit low-key for me, but tomorrow the Hubby and I are going up to SF for Wanderlust! It's an all-day yoga festival which I am VERY excited for! Gonna get so centered! ;)
