Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you all doing today? Can you even believe that it’s August already? Hubby, puppy, and I have been in California for half a year already – that’s CRAZY! Time definitely flies when you’re having fun ;)

Today’s tutorial is one of the simplest yet! All you need is ONE nail polish color and a dotting tool! If you want to do exactly what I did, you can also use faux jewels for the flower centers and hole reinforcement stickers if you’re like me and can’t freehand French tips ;) So let’s get started with some:

**Flower Accents**

Step 1: Supplies! As I said above, you need very little for this manicure:

- Clear base & top coat
- Nail polish in the color of your choice
- Dotting tool for the flower petals

Optional:

* Hole reinforcement stickers (if unable to freehand French tips)
* Faux crystals in the color of your choice (for the flower center)
* Nail glue (for the faux crystals)
* Tweezers (to hold the faux crystals if they’re too small for your fingers to grip)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer. Add on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Tip it! Now take out your hole reinforcement stickers (if you need them) and rip a small tear in them. This helps the stickers lay flat while you’re painting. Lay the stickers just below the part of your nail where it changes from skin tone to light/white.  Then take your nail polish and paint a few thin coats on the exposed tip of your nail.

Give the polish a few moments to air dry, and then slowly peel away the sticker.

(Side note: THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH TIP I HAVE EVER DONE. I am stupidly proud of it, hahaha)

Step 4: Dot it! Now let’s make some flowers! Take a piece of paper/plastic and drip some of your polish onto it. Then, using your dotting tool, make five dots in a circle on your nail. I put mine near the nail base, but you can place yours wherever you like! That’s the beauty of DIY nail art ;)

Step 5: Jewel it! Alright, now we have our gorgeous tips and flowers, but I think we need some SPARKLE. I chose to use some golden jewels which, when combined with the white petals, gives a cute daisy look!

If you’re adding the jewels, first take a small amount of your nail glue and dab it in the center of the petals. Then, using your tweezers/fingers/jewel-grabbing-apparatus, place the crystal in the center of the petals. Press down lightly for a moment to get it to stick, and then let the glue dry. Repeat this for all of your flower fingers.

Step 6: Finish it! Alright, now we just have to paint on the clear top coat, clean up the edges and voila! A cute and simple accent to increase your manicure’s adorability by a hundred-fold!

I love love LOVE this manicure! I went to Starbucks for breakfast this morning and I couldn’t stop staring at my fingers while I was waiting for my Frapuccino! Some might have said I looked strange, but I just say that’s the sign of a great manicure ;)

Side note: Don’t you think these would be SUPER cute for a wedding? If any of you ladies are getting married soon, here’s an idea for you free of charge ;) (But if you use them PLEASE send me a picture! I’d love to see them!)

That’s all from me this week! I’m really excited for this upcoming week – it’s hubby’s and my anniversary on Thursday (three years!), and we’re going on an SF-to-Napa wine tour! I’m so excited!

Have a wonderful week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
