Happy Wednesday everybody! I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving, and that your Christmas season is off to a great start :)

I’m keeping things simple for this week’s tutorial: French Tips. But here’s an alternative way to painting them using something you already have in the house: rubber bands!

**Tutorial: Rubber Band French Tips**

Step 1: Supplies! You only need three things for this manicure: clear base/top coat, white nail polish, and a rubber band.

Step 2: Prep! Clean and prep your nails however you prefer, and put on a clear base coat.

Step 3: Rubber band it!  Wrap the band around your nail and hold it secure with your other fingers.

Step 4: Paint it! Paint the tip of your nail with the white polish, going up to the rubber band to create the straight border.

Step 5: Finish! Take off the rubber band, wait for the paint to dry, and then seal up the nail with a clear top coat.

And there you have it! I usually do my French Tips free-handed or with scotch tape, but this is another fun and easy way to get perfectly straight lines for your tips every time. :) Have a great day everyone, see you next time!
