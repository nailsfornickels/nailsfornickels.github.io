Hey everybody! Did you have a nice weekend? The weather here was GORGEOUS so I got to go on another hike yesterday :) But of course it’s chilly today, and then it’s supposed to snow tomorrow. Oh Colorado, you’re so silly and fickle <3

This week we’re keeping things funky: I’m going to show you how to do

**Tiger Stripes!**

Step 1: Supplies! To do your tiger nails, you will need clear top and base coat, orange polish, black polish, a surface to drip paint on, and a paintbrush. (You can substitute a toothpick for the brush if you don’t have one on hand, but I found that the brush works better for the lines.)

Step 2: Paint it! After buffing and polishing your nails in any style you prefer, put the base coat on your nails. After that dries, paint your nails orange.

Step 3: Stripe it! After the orange has dried, you’re ready to do your stripes. Take the paint surface and drip some of the black polish on it. Then, taking your paintbrush, begin painting the stripes on your nails. I found it helpful to google “tiger stripes” and have a picture pulled up, so I knew what patterns to do. :)

Note: Painting your dominant hand with your other hand can be TOUGH, but don’t give up! I had to do my right hand twice before I got the stripes right. So just remember that this manicure requires patience, but it comes out looking awesome in the end. ;)

Step 4: Finish it! That’s all there is to it- once the stripes dry, seal your nails with the top coat and clean up the edges.

Enjoy those funky stripes! Rrowr!
