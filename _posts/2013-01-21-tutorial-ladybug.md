Happy Monday everyone!

Here in Colorado we are having a GORGEOUS week, and I got to go hiking with my hubby and our puppy yesterday. With the beauty of nature all around us, I decided that this week we should do a nature-themed manicure. So let’s get started!

**Ladybug Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need clear base and top coat, red, black, and white nail polish, a dotting tool, a rubber band, a toothpick, and a surface to drip paint on.

Step 2: Paint it! After buffing and cleaning your nails, paint the clear base coat on your nails followed by the red nail polish.

Step 5: Finish it! Take your toothpick and add two small white dots on the tips of each nail (these are the “eyes” of your ladybugs ;) )

Finish the manicure by cleaning the edges and sealing with the top coat.

And now you have happy little ladybugs to grace your fingernails! Happy Monday everyone, see you next week! <3
