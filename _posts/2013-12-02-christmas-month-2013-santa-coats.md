Happy Monday, my lovely readers! And happy December!

I am SO ecstatic – Christmas is my favorite holiday hands down, and I absolutely adore this time of year. Every year I get so impatient around Thanksgiving, because I just want to get it out of the way so I can put up decorations and listen to Christmas music without anyone thinking I’m a crazy person. ;)

Since I love Christmas so very very much, I obviously have to do something special! So I’m going to do my best to showcase Christmas-themed manicures every Monday from now through December 25th. Let’s get started on “the most wonderful time of the year” with some:

**Santa Coat Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in red, white, black, and gold
- Hole reinforcement stickers
- White flocking powder (white glitter could work too, but then you won’t get the fuzzy factor :) )
- Something to catch excess powder/glitter (I used a piece of paper)

If you don’t have any flocking powder that’s okay! I’ll also be showing you how to do the white trim with just white nail polish.

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails in the style you prefer, and paint them with the clear base coat.

(Side note: My poor nails are so short! My hubby and I moved over the weekend and the process absolutely DESTROYED my nails. So I’m glad I have this manicure to cover them up and help them heal! *laughs*)

Step 3: Paint it! Once the clear coat has dried, paint all of your nails with the red polish. I absolutely love this Sally Hansen polish for the holidays, because the red is sparkly but subtle. :)

Step 4: Tip it! Once the red polish has COMPLETELY dried (you can rub the nails against each other without any tack), take out your stickers. Place them on your nail, leaving the tip of each nail exposed (like you’re doing a French manicure).

Then, using your white polish, paint the exposed tips of your nails white.

Give the polish a moment to air dry, and then peel away the stickers.

Step 5: Belt it! Take your black polish and, using the bottle’s built in brush, paint a horizontal stripe across the center of each nail. This is the “belt” of the coat.

Step 6: Buckle it! Now, using your gold polish, paint a small vertical stripe on the center of the belt. You can paint any shape you like for the belt “buckle”, I just found the stripe to be the easiest. :)

Step 7: Top coat it! Paint your nails with a coat or two of the clear top coat and WAIT. The nails need to be completely dry before proceeding on to the fluffy step.

[Side note: If you’re foregoing using the flocking powder, skip these last steps. Just paint on your top coat, clean up the edges, and you’re done!]

Step 8: Stick it (again)! Place your hole reinforcement stickers on the nails again, lining them up with the white tips. Then, with your powder and paper ready and waiting, paint the tip of your nail with the clear coat.

Step 9: Powder it! When the clear coat is on the tip, sprinkle your flocking powder over it.

After a moment or two, peel away the sticker.

Step 10: Finish it! That’s all there is to it! :) Clean up the edges and you have some festive nails to kick off the holiday season.

So far the feedback has been really positive on these nails. When I went to get coffee yesterday my barista also had Christmas-y nails (She had snowflakes! So cute!), so we geeked out on nail art for a second. ;)

Also, pro-tip that I discovered yesterday: Fuzzy nails are MUCH more manageable during the warm months when you aren’t wearing fuzzy, cold weather clothes! Every time I brushed my nails against my pea coat, I came away with dark fibers stuck in the white flocking powder. Not fun! :P
