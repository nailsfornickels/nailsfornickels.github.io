Happy Tuesday everyone! Sorry this post is late, I did my nails yesterday but then didn’t take the final picture until late last night. :P So have a Tuesday manicure tutorial!

This week, we’re doing a fun nail that can be done in any colors you care for. It’s time for:

**Polka Dots!**

Now there are a few different ways to get the dot look. You can free-hand it using the nail polish brush, buy some professional dotting tools (I’ve seen some pretty inexpensive ones on Amazon), or make your own dotting tool using flat head sequin needles!

I used the needle method. The end of the needle I have is blunt, but if you have some with sharp ends, just push them into the eraser of a pencil to keep from poking those pretty fingers while you’re dotting ;)

Now let’s get our Polka Dot on!

Step 1: Supplies! You will need clear base and top coat, your dotting tool, a piece of paper to drip polish on, and two bottles of nail polish for your base color and dot color. I used a very pale pink for my base, and black for my dots.

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, trim, and buff your nails in the manner you prefer, then throw on the clear base coat.

Step 2: Paint it! After the clear coat dries, paint on your base color.

Step 3: Get the dots ready! Take your dot polish, and pour some of it onto the piece of paper. Then, take your dotting tool, and dip it into the paint.

Step 4: Dot it! Press the tip of the painted pin onto your nails, and dot them in any pattern you choose.

Step 5: Finish it! After you’ve finished dotting and the paint has dried, clean up the edges and seal the manicure with another clear coat.

And voila! This is a great manicure for any time of the year, and it looks great. :)
