Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How’s everyone doing today? I just got back from working out this morning and I am SORE *laughs* But that’s not important – what’s important is Christmas-themed nail art! So let’s dive right in to today’s post:

**Christmas Month 2014: Christmas Confetti**

Today’s manicure is very simple, with a splash of Christmas whimsy. Polka dots and Christmas – what could be a better combination? And this manicure is SO simple to create. All you have to do is paint your nails with a base coat of white (or your preferred color), and then scatter dots of various sizes and colors across the nail.

(My poor thumb is so beat up, don’t look at it! *laughs*)

For my nails, I selected green, red, and gold for the dots. The most Christmas-y colors there are! I used a larger dotting tool for the dots at the tips of the nails, and used progressively smaller dotting tools for the dots moving to the nail bases. I also placed fewer dots as I went further up, creating an almost wedge and/or gradient look.

If you don’t have dotting tools, I highly recommend getting some! They are an awesome tool to have in your nail art arsenal, and they are very inexpensive. I think I got my set of five on Amazon for less than two dollars.

That’s all from me this week, my lovelies! And also, I’m going out of town next weekend to visit family for Christmas, so next week’s post will be early. It will be the final Christmas Month 2014 one, as well as the last post of the year! But it’s a good one, so get excited ;)

Have a great week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
