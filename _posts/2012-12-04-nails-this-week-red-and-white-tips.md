Hey all! We are officially into December, so let’s get started with the Christmas-y manicures!

This week I did alternating red and white nails with opposing tips. All this requires is the base color, and painting the tips either free-handed, with scotch tape, or using [the rubber band method](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-rubber-band-french-tips/).

Enjoy, and Happy December!
