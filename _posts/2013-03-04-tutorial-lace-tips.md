Happy Monday everybody!

This last Saturday was my birthday, I am officially 23! In two years I’ll be able to rent a car from any rental agency in the U.S. without paying additional fees ;) Haha yeah this is an exciting number.

I have another tutorial for you guys with the fun supplies I stocked up on at Michaels a few weeks ago:

**Lace Tips!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base coat
- Clear top coat
- 1 nail polish color of your choice (I chose a light turquoise)
- Lace (I used a roll of black lace ribbon)
- Cuticle trimmers OR small manicure scissors (to trim the lace)
- Tweezers (to press down the lace)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean and shape your nails however you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! After the base coat dries, paint on your color polish.

Wait for the polish to COMPLETELY dry! (I watched “Elementary” while waiting :) )

[Side note: Like the Velvet Nails and the Feather Nails, complete steps 4-6 ONE nail at a time]

Step 4: Prep your lace! Cut off a section of the lace that you want to use on your nails.

Take that piece of lace, and trim off smaller pieces to roughly fit your nail.

Step 5: Coat it & stick it! Paint your nail with a nice, thick coating of the clear base coat, and press down your trimmed lace using the tweezers.

Step 6: Trim & seal it! Once the lace is firmly attached (let the base coat dry for a little bit), trim off the excess lace with your small trimmers and seal the nail with a few coat of the clear top coat.

Repeat steps 4-6 with your other nails, clean up the edges and voila! You have some lovely lace nails to show off for any occasion!
