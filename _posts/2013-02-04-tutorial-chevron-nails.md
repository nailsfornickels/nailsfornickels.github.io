Happy Monday everybody! For those of you who watched it, did you enjoy the Superbowl? I didn’t even know it was happening until my brother told me on Friday, so the hubby and I went grocery shopping while everyone else was at home watching the game. ;) Getting stuff DONE!

Last week on Pinterest (I’m OBSESSED by the way, you can follow me [here](http://www.pinterest.com/thedragonbabe/) ), I was seeing a ridiculous amount of Chevron-themed accessories and apparel. While I was perusing, I thought to myself “Hey, I can do that!”, so this week I’ll be showing you how to do your very own

**Chevron Manicure**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need clear base and top coat, tape, and three nail polish colors of your choice. I did pale pink, light turquoise, and black, all from Sinful Colors.

Step 2: Paint it! After buffing and cleaning your nails, paint on the clear coat, followed by the base color (this will be the bottom or top color, depending on which way you have the points oriented).

Step 3: Wait! I CANNOT stress this enough, this manicure takes TIME. Like I said in my [candy corn tutorial](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-halloween-candy-corn/), you need to be patient when doing color layer manicures. If the polish is even slightly tacky, you might take off most of the polish when you peel away the scotch tape. So patience is a virtue for this manicure ;) I like to do these mani styles while watching tv, that way I can be entertained and not risk hurting the polish by doing something with my hands. I would recommend at least 20 minutes for each color, maybe longer depending on the thickness of each color coat.

Step 4: Get the tape ready! When it feels safe to use your hands without risk of messing up the polish, take two pieces of tape and put them in an X-formation. Make sure that the sides match, and both pieces of tape have the sticky side facing down.

With your tape oriented like this, fold the bottom right section UNDER, so that the sticky side is meeting the sticky side of the center square.

Repeat this step with the bottom left corner, so that you have a V-shaped piece of tape.

You can just keep the X-shaped tape and do the Chevron points that way, but I like folding the opposite side underneath into this V so that, while I’m working, there is a non-sticky part of the tape to grip. :)

Step 5: Tape it & Paint it! Once your tape is ready and your nails are dry, you’re ready to begin the second color. Take your V-tape, and orient it so that the “point” is in the center of your nail.

(Side note: Whoops! I forgot to take a picture of when I first did the turquoise, so these photos are for the third color [black]. But the process is the same: paint, wait, tape, and paint. The tape would just be lower down for starting the second color :) )

I had my points facing down, towards the nail base, so my tape was oriented like the example above, but if you want the points facing up turn the tape around and cover the top portion of your nail instead of the bottom.

Once your tape is in place (and make sure it’s securely on your nail, otherwise the lines will be really messy), paint on your next color.

Step 6: Peel it & Finish it! After you paint on the next layer of color, peel the tape away to reveal those beautiful points.

After you’ve painted all three layers for all of the nails, clean up the edges and seal the manicure with the clear top coat.

Ta-da! This technique is awesome, because you can do it with any colors you please. Cool colors for winter, warm colors for summer, complementary colors, opposing colors- the options are endless!

I hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial, and please feel free to leave a comment below! And hey, if any of you do this manicure, I’d love to see some pictures!
