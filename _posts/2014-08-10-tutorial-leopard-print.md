Happy Sunday, my lovelies! So I have some exciting news:

The job hunt is over!! I just started the paperwork for my new job and I should be starting soon. Ahhh I’m so relieved, job-hunting can be very soul-crushing so I’m ecstatic that it’s over :) I can’t wait to get started!

Also, this past Thursday was hubby’s and my anniversary (three years!), and we went on a winery tour through Sonoma and Napa valley. It was lots of fun! We restocked our wine supply and got to do a California thing we hadn’t yet :)

How has YOUR week been? I hope that it’s been wonderful! I have a fun and funky tutorial for you this week, so let’s get started with:

**Tutorial: Leopard Print**

Step 1: Supplies! For this style, you will need:

* Clear base & top coat
* Three nail polish colors: the base, the spots, and the outlines. I chose white, neon pink, and black.
* A small dotting tool or toothpick
* A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Base it! Now take the polish you have selected for your base color and paint your entire nail. Use 2-3 coats, or however many it takes to get a nice and solid base color.

Step 4: Splotch it! Now let’s add the beginnings of the leopard spots. You can use a larger dotting tool for this if you like, but I was able to just use the polish brush. Instead of perfect circles, the spot color can be painted on in more “splotchy” shapes – leopard spots aren’t symmetrical, so your polish shouldn’t be either.

Step 5: Outline it! Now take your outline color and drip some of it onto your paper/plastic. Then, using the small dotting tool/toothpick, begin to outline your spots. I recommend doing two small lines on opposite sides that follow the border of the main splotch. For some nails I also threw in tiny dots of the outline color in the blank spaces.

Step 6: Finish it! Once the polish had dried (to prevent any streaking), paint on your clear base coat to seal your nail art. Clean up the edges and voila! You have some jungle cat fierceness gracing your fingers/toes.

I could not BELIEVE how simple leopard print is! I actually found it MUCH easier than tiger stripes, and I just love how much this design pops (granted, the hot pink helps with that *laughs*)

I mean seriously, if you’re looking for a manicure to do next give these a try! I was watching Elementary with my hubby and doing my nails, and the entire manicure took me about the length of an episode (time was added on because I had to take off my flower details nails from last week). It’s just so simple!

Alright everyone, that’s it for me this week. I hope you all have a lovely week! I’ll see you next time <3
