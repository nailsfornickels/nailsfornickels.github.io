Hello, lovely readers! I hope you’re all having a wonderful start to the week!

I have been LOVING the gorgeous weather lately, so naturally it’s made me want to do some summery nails. And what better way to do that than with fruit-themed nails? None that I can think of. ;) Now let’s get ready to make some:

**Strawberry Nails!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat (Which I forgot to include in the picture… Whoops!)
- Nail polish in red, green, and white
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on
- Tape
- A toothpick
- Scissors (manicure or regular size will work)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and style your nails in the manner you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint your nails with 2-3 coats of the red polish to ensure you have a rich base color.

Step 4: Cut it! Take out the tape and your scissors. Cut small points across the edge of a piece of tape. This will provide the guideline for the “leaves” of your strawberries.

Step 5: Wait and then paint! Wait until the red polish is COMPLETELY dry before moving on to this step. (Tip: If you can press and rub your painted nails against each other without any tack, then they’re probably good. :) ) Once the red is dry, lay the piece of tape down so the pointed edge is pointed towards the cuticle side (or “base”) of your nail with a bit of space open between the tape and cuticle. Take your green polish and paint the base of your nail green.

Remove the tape after you’ve painted on enough green polish to have a solid color.

Step 6: Seed it! Drip a small amount of your white nail polish onto the piece of paper/plastic. Then, using the tip of the toothpick, begin dotting tiny “seeds” onto the red part of your nails.

Step 7: Finish it! Once your polish is dry, seal your manicure with a clear top coat, clean up the edges, and voila! A lovely, summertime strawberry manicure! I guarantee this will be a huge hit, I lost count of the number of compliments I got on these nails. :)
