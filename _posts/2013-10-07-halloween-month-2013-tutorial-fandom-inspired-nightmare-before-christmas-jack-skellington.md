*“This is Halloween, this is Halloween, pumpkins scream in the dead of night”*

Happy Monday, my lovely readers!

*-looks up at the title-*

Wow, that’s a bit of a mouthful huh? ;) But I am so excited for this tutorial today! “The Nightmare Before Christmas” is one of my all-time favorite movies, and my Halloween Month 2013 run is the perfect time to do a Pumpkin King-themed manicure. So without any further ado, let’s get started with:

**“Nightmare Before Christmas” Jack Skellington Nails**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in black and white
- A thin paintbrush
- A toothpick
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip paint on
- White striping tape (or can paint white strips with your thin paintbrush)
- Cuticle nippers/small manicure scissors to trim the striping tape

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint your nails with the black and white polish. For Jack Skellington heads, paint on the white polish. For the black and white pinstripes, paint on the black polish.

Step 4: Pinstripe nails! Take the white striping tape and put three vertical lines on each black nail. Trim the edges with your cuticle nippers/manicure scissors.

Step 5: Jack heads! For the Jack heads, first put the eyes on the nails. You can use a large dotting tool or just drip a circle of the black polish using the bottle brush. Using the toothpick, paint two small dashes under the eyes to create Jack’s nostrils.

Next, drip some black paint onto your piece of paper/plastic.

Take your small paintbrush and paint a line along the curve of your nail’s edge. Paint this line like you would if you were doing French tips.

Drip some more black polish onto your paper/plastic if needed and get out your toothpick.

Paint a series of small vertical dashes across the line of Jack’s “mouth”. These are his “stitches”.

Step 6: Finish it! Seal your manicure with a top coat, clean up the edges, and voila! A super fabulous Jack Skellington manicure to show off your love of “The Nightmare Before Christmas” and your love of Halloween!
