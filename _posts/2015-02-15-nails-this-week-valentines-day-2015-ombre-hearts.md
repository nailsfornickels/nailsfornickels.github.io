Happy Sunday, my lovelies! And happy day after Valentine’s Day! *laughs* Did everyone enjoy their holiday? Ours was very low-key and lovely :)

So I meant to get this post up before Valentine’s Day, but I kept getting sidetracked. So here it is a day late: my nails for Valentine’s Day 2015! I did a pink and red ombre and then painted small white hearts on top.

If you don’t know how to, check out my tutorial [here](/tutorial-ombre-fall-colors/) to see how to do ombre nails. It’s super easy and it’s my favorite type of nail art to do :)
