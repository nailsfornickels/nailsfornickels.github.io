Happy Tuesday, everyone! Did everyone have a nice holiday season? I had an awesome time! Hubby and I got to go to Europe and then we went back out to Colorado for Christmas. It was a wonderful December!

Also.

I found something.

Maybe you've heard of a little anime called ["Yuri on Ice"](http://www.crunchyroll.com/yuri-on-ice)?

I bet you have because the internet exploded when it started airing! And I did too - for twelve weeks I absolutely lost my mind and counted down the seconds until the latest episode premiered. Seriously, I haven't been this head over heels for an anime since "Erased", and I can't even remember the one before that!

Plus, you know, it's kind of hard to make nail art around the plot line of "Erased" ;) *laughs*

But oh my GOSH YOI was fantastic! The animation was gorgeous, the storyline was amazing, and the music was so beautiful! I knew I had to create SOMETHING for a YOI Fandom tutorial, and after the final episode it was obvious what I had to make. So without further ado, I present to you:

## Fandom Inspired: Yuri on Ice - Pair Skate

Supplies! For this manicure you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in 5 different colors: light and dark pink for Victor, light and dark blue for Yuuri, and black for the lapels of both.
- Makeup sponges
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on (I recommend plastic wrap - chances are you've already got some!)
- Tweezers
- Manicure scissors/cuticle nippers
- Gold and silver striping tape
- Gold and silver nail art discs (is there a name for these? *laughs*)
- Nail glue (If unavailable, you can use a bit of clear coat! It will just take a bit longer to dry.)

Step 1: Prep it! Clean, buff, and shape your nails the way you prefer, and then add on your base coat.

Step 2: Base color! Paint your nails with the base color of the skater's outfit. On my left hand I did Victor and on my right hand I did Yuuri. For each hand do the lighter color - so light pink and light blue!

Step 3: Ombre! Now drip both colors onto your plastic and dab your makeup sponge in the polish before applying to your nail. For more information on creating an ombre effect, see my tutorial [here](/tutorial-ombre-fall-colors/).

Step 4: Lapels! Once the ombre has dried, take your black polish and paint two vertical stripes on either side of your nail. I did the lapels on my thumbs and middle fingers.

Step 5: Strings! Once the lapels are dry, take out the striping tape and cuticle nippers and snip off a small piece of striping tape. It should be long enough to reach across the space between the two lapels. Place two pieces of tape horizontally across the lapels and press down to adhere. Silver on the blue for Yuuri, and gold on the pink for Victor!

Step 6: Buttons! Take your nail glue and adhere a nail art button to each end of your pieces of striping tape. This creates the decorative ropes & buttons on Victor and Yuuri's costumes!

Step 7: Finish it! Seal your manicure with the top coat and clean up the edges of your nails using acetone. And there you have it!

I loved doing these nails! One of my favorite things to do with nerdy nail art is to create a style that's subtly nerdy. By using the color scheme or a simple design I can reference something that other fans will recognize, but it will just look like normal nail art to non-fans :)

Also, do you guys want to hear something amazing? I was actually in Barcelona when episode 11 aired! You know, when everyone was in Barcelona for the worlds? I lost my MIND when I was watching that episode! Phichit took a selfie in front of the Sagrada Familia and I went "Hey, I was there yesterday! I took that same selfie!"

I had a blast and a half doing these nails, and I hope you've enjoyed seeing them! Now I'm going to patiently twiddle my thumbs while I wait to find another series to fall head-over-heels for <3

That's all, my lovelies! See you next time!
