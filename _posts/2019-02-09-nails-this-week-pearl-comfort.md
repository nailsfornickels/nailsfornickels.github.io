Happy Saturday, my lovelies! How's it hanging on this chilly February day? We've had a ton of rain in the Bay, so it's been a lot of staying in the last couple of weeks! But it's been nice, because the relaxed time has actually got my creative juices flowing! I've picked up a new hobby (more details in the future!), been getting back into drawing, and, of course, got some new nail art for you!

Neutral tones with nude pearls is such a comforting color scheme to me. I love the looks of these nails against a cozy sweater or some soft lace. Perfect for being cuddled under a blanket with the rainy day outside!

To get this look, I made an extended half-moon curve with white polish along each nail, painted a coat of the crystal glitter coat, and then glued a small pearl in the center of each curve.

That's all for this week, my lovelies! Stay warm/dry/happy, and I'll see you next time!
