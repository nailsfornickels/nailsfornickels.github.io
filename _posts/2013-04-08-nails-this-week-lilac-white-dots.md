Good morning lovely readers! And welcome to another “Nails This Week” post on Nails for Nickels!

I bought this GORGEOUS lilac polish at Ulta last week, and I just KNEW I had to make my next post with it.

The only sad thing is these nails totally look Easter-themed, so I wish I had had the polish earlier ;)
