Happy Sunday, my lovelies! How are you all doing today? Did you have a nice Halloween? Apologies about the lack of a post last week – a cold has been going around my office and it was my turn to get it, so I was down Friday evening and didn’t feel better until Tuesday :P But all good today!

Hubby and I saw “Nightcrawler” last night, and it was really good! Jake Gyllenhaal did an AMAZING job, I think it was Oscar worthy :) So if you’re looking for something to see I’d definitely recommend it!

Let’s see, what else has been going on this weekend… Oh! Hubby & I have already decorated the apartment for Christmas :D Yes I am absolutely one of those people who starts Christmas on November 1st and I am not ashamed *laughs* It’s still weird to be putting up a tree when it’s totally sunny & warm outside (California you’re so temperate!), but we’ll get used to it ;) Anyhoo, let’s get on with the post. This week I’m going back to a simple nail with a shiny twist:

Check out my first “Wood Nails” post [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/nails-this-week-wood-nails/) for more information on how you can do these wood nails at home.

I really love the look of these! But then again, I love anything with a 3D touch *laughs* But I really love the simplicity of these nails: they are so easy to create (literally all you need is two brown polishes and studs if you have/want them) and the finished product looks so cool and unique. Nail art doesn’t have to be hard!

Well today’s a quick and easy post, so that’s all from me. Have a great week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
