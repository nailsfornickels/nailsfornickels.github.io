Happy Sunday, lovelies! How’s your week been? I hope it’s been great! I started watching “Twin Peaks” this week – it’s strange but I like it :D

Speaking of the strange and spooky, it’s time for another Halloween Month 2014 post:

**Halloween Month 2014: Spooky Trees**

The process for these nails is very simple and straightforward. I did an ombre base color with yellow and orange to achieve a “sunset in autumn” look. If you don’t know how to do ombre/gradient nails, check out my tutorial [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-ombre-fall-colors/).

After the base dried, I then took black polish and painted on some branches using a tiny dotting tool (you could also use a toothpick or small makeup brush). To see how to do branches on your nails, check out my cherry blossom tutorials [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-cherry-blossoms/) and [here](http://nailsfornickels.com/tutorial-cherry-blossoms-2-with-bonus-coordinated-toes/).

I really love how this manicure came out! I think it’s very evocative of a spooky Halloween night, but also perfect for a fall mani :)

Alright my dears, that’s all from me for today. Have a great day and enjoy the rest of your week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
