Happy Monday, my lovely readers! How are you on this fine morning? I hope that you have an exciting week coming your way. :)

I have a very cute and very easy tutorial for you this week, and of course it’s Valentine’s Day themed! So let’s get started with this week’s post:

**Tutorial: Valentine’s Day Hearts & French Tips**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- White nail polish
- Red nail polish
- Hole reinforcement stickers (if you can’t do French tips by hand)
- A toothpick
- Faux red jewels (if you want to do one of your fingers like my ring finger)

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on a clear base coat.

Step 3: Stickers! If you’re doing your French tips by hand, do those now. If you need the stickers, place them on your fingers with a small piece of the nail tip exposed. Take your white polish and paint a couple of coats onto the exposed tips.

Wait a few moments, and then peel off the stickers.

Step 4: Heart it! Now get your red polish and your toothpick ready. First, near the tip of your fingernail, drip two dots of red polish (using the brush) onto your nail.

Next, take the toothpick and drag it through each of the dots in a diagonal, downwards fashion. The streams of polish should meet to create a point. Fill in any blank spots if necessary, and you have a heart!

Step 5: Finish it! Paint hearts on your other nails and do the jeweled tips if you like. Seal your manicure with a top coat, clean up the edges, and voila! A cute and easy manicure for you to sport when you’re out with your sweetie on Valentine’s Day. :)

I’m not quite sure what my hubby and I will be doing – since we’re in a new town I’d love to find some nice restaurants, so that’s probably on our agenda. :)
