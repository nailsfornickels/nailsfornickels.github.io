Happy Saturday, my lovelies! And a happy spring to you!

How has the weather been in your neck of the woods? We've had quite a few rainy weeks in the Bay Area, then had a hot week, then another slightly rainy week last week, and now the weather's getting lovely again. The flowers are blooming, the birds are singing: I think spring is officially here!

I got together with a friend for a coffee catch-up last weekend, and she asked me if I've seen this super cute dried flower nail trend. I have, but for whatever reason didn't think to do it myself until she brought it up! So I immediately jumped online and ordered some small dried flowers to do this manicure (lol).

Aren't these adorable?? The flowers I ordered came with two different flower types: small stems with tiny petals at the end, and larger flattened blossoms. So when I was putting together this manicure I wanted to have variety within the theme.

The colors I chose were green, pink, yellow, and white. I placed pink blossoms on each thumb, yellow blossoms on each middle finger, did solid pink for the fourth fingers, and then a trio of green, white, and pink stems on each of the other fingers.

Doing manicures like this is the same as it is for any nail art that involves 3d decorations: after the base coat has dried (and color if you're using any), you paint a clear layer where your decorations will go. Depending on what you have on hand, you can use regular clear coat OR nail glue. Then using tweezers, a wax pencil, or even your fingers if your dextrous enough, place the decoration over the tacky area. Wait for the adhesive to dry, then paint a clear top coat over to seal in your gorgeous design! For examples of this technique, you can check out other tutorials where I've used 3d decoration: [Lace Tips](/tutorial-lace-tips/), [Feather Nails](/tutorial-feather-nails/), and [Doctor Who Daleks](/fandom-inspired-doctor-who-daleks/).
