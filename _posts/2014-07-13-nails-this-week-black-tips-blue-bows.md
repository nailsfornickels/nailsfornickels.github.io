Happy Sunday, my lovelies!

Oh my goodness, Anime Expo was SO MUCH FUN!! I went to the Sailor Moon Panels, the SAO panel, got an awesome Makoto from Free! charm, and had a blasty blast and a half! Hubby and I definitely want to go back next year :)

Keeping things simple this week! Just did some black French Tips (courtesy of hole reinforcement stickers), and glued some decorative blue bows onto the ring finger of each hand.

Aren’t the bows cute?? I bought them off Amazon a while ago, but haven’t had a chance to use them until now! Adhering them is very simple – just a dot of nail glue on the back of each bow and press them to the nail.

So what have you lovelies been up to this week? Anything special? And did my American readers have a happy Fourth of July? :) I hope so! This week was pretty uneventful for me – I’ve been working on a side project to keep my programming chops sharp, and otherwise just continuing the job hunt.

That’s all from me today, my dears! I hope you all have a lovely week, and I’ll see you next time <3
