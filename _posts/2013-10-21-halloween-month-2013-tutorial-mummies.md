Happy Monday, my spooky readers!

I am VERY excited about the tutorial for this week of Halloween Month 2013! I’ve been trying to figure out the method for this manicure for some time now, and I finally figured it out this past week. You’re gonna love it, everyone! So let’s get started with:

**Mummies!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:
-Clear base and top coat
-Striping tape
-Cuticle nippers or small manicure scissors
-Nail polish in black, white, and a light tan/beige

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff and shape your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on your clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint all of your nails with the black polish.

Step 4: Tape it! Take your striping tape and put the strips on your nails once the black polish dries. Place the stripes at varying angles in order to convey the wrapped effect of bandages. Cut the strips with the cuticle nippers/manicure scissors.

Step 5: Paint it (again)! Take your beige/tan polish and paint your nails over the striping tape.

Wait a few moments for the polish to dry a little bit, and then gently peel off the tape to reveal the black stripes.

Step 6: Dot it (the first)! Once the tan polish dries, take out your white polish and (using either the brush or a dotting tool), paint two white dots onto your nail. You can place the “eyes” anywhere on the nails you’d like! I put mine on different places for each nail.

Step 7: Dot it (the second)! Now take your black polish and once again (using either the built-in brush or a dotting tool) paint “pupils” on the “eyes”.

Step 8: Finish it! Seal your manicure with the clear top coat, clean up the edges of your nails, and you’re done!
