Hey all! Sorry for the long gap between posts, but my hubby and I are officially moved into our new place!

Since this week is Thanksgiving, I thought we should get in a fall-themed tutorial before beginning the Christmas-themed manicures. So without further ado, I give you:

**Ombre Fall Colors** 

(Side note: I first found this ombre/gradient technique on [The Nailasaurus’](http://www.thenailasaurus.com/2012/04/gradient-nails-picture-tutorial.html) blog. She is a brilliant nail artist, and you should definitely check out her work :) )

Step One: Supplies! You’ll need quite a few more supplies for this manicure than my other tutorials, but it ends up looking GREAT! You’ll need makeup wedges or small sponge slivers, toothpicks, pieces of paper or plastic (something you don’t mind getting paint on), top and base clear coat, and nail polish in brown, red, yellow, orange, white, and black.

(Side note: you can use any colors you like for the ombre technique, but I chose these colors because they’re fall-tastic! :) )

Step 2: Nail prep! Clean and buff your nails in whatever style you prefer, then put on a coat of clear base coat.

Step 3: Base color! For the fall colors, I did brown for the base coat. Make sure to put on about two coats, so that there aren’t any gaps or transparent areas in the color.

Step 4: Prepping the ombre paint! On your piece of plastic or paper, dab a spot of the base color and a spot of the second color next to each other.

Next, take a toothpick, and swirl the two colors together in the center.

Third, take one of the makeup sponges, and dab it on the paint.

Step 5: Sponge the nails! Take your sponge and in small up and down motions dab it along your nail. You will have to repeat steps 4 and 5 at least twice to get the colors rich enough.

If you are doing multiple colors, you will have to have separate paint spots and sponges for each color. I did a different color for each nail, so here’s what my paper and sponges looked like at the end:

Step 6: Top coat and clean up! As the final step, put a clear top coat on your nails to seal in the color, and then use either a small paintbrush or a q-tip dipped in nail polish remover to clean up the edges.

And you are done! Ombre nails are one of my favorite manicures to do, and I hope you have as much fun with them as I do :)
