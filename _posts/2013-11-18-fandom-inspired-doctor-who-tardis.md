Happy Monday, my wonderful readers! And an extra-happy Monday to my fellow Whovians – the 50th anniversary special of Doctor Who is this Saturday! Who’s excited? I know I am! Hubby and I are throwing a party to watch the special, is anyone else doing anything fun for the party? Let me know in the comments!

To celebrate, I of COURSE had to do some Who-themed nails, so let’s get started with

**Fandom Inspired: “Doctor Who” TARDIS**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in blue and white (try to get as close to the TARDIS blue as you can!)
- Tape
- Striping tape
- Cuticle clippers

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and style you nails in the manner you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint all of your nails with the blue polish.

Wait until the polish is COMPLETELY dry (able to rub your nails against each other without any tack) before proceeding.

Step 4: Tape it! Take your scotch tape and section off the top third of your nail. Take the striping tape and, using the cuticle nippers to cut the tape, place two pieces in a cross pattern on the un-taped top of your nail.

Step 5: Paint it! Take out your white polish and paint the top part of your nail.

After giving the polish a moment to air dry, peel off the striping tape and scotch tape.

Step 6: Finish it! Seal your manicure with the clear top coat, clean off the edges of your nails, and voila!

A simple and fun manicure that shows off your Whovian pride nicely.

I love this manicure because it emulates the TARDIS (the blue of the exterior and the window panes), but it also makes for a cute manicure if you’re not into the show :)

Whichever camp you fall into, I hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s Fandom Inspired tutorial. And for the Whovians reading, have a great time watch “The Day of the Doctor”! Allons-y!
