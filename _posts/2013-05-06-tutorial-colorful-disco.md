**Colorful Disco Nails!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Five polish colors of your choosing (I used purple, green, pink, blue, and red)
- Black polish
- Silver OR gold sparkle (I used silver) polish
- Tape

Step 2: Base it! After cleaning and buffing your nails in the shape you prefer, paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once the base coat has dried, paint your different color polishes on each nail. Use 2-3 coats (or however many it takes) to get a nice solid base color.

Step 4: Tape it! Once the paint is COMPLETELY dry (all tack has to be gone), take a piece of tape and lay it at an angle on your nail so that roughly a third of your nail is uncovered by the tape.

Step 5: Paint it! Take your black polish and paint the uncovered part of the nail.

After painting, peel away the tape.

Step 6: Tape it again! After the black polish is COMPLETELY dry, you’ll repeat step 5 with the silver or gold polish. But this time, move the piece of tape upwards so that a section of the black is covered.

Paint with the silver or gold polish, and peel the tape away once painted.

Step 7: Finish it! After the polish has dried on all nails, paint on the clear top coat and clean up the edges.

And you’re done! I got multiple compliments on these nails, they’re just so colorful and fun! I hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial, and I’ll see you next time.
