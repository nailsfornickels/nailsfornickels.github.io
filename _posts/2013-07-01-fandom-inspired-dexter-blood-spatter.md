Hello, my lovelies! I hope you all had a wonderful weekend!

Last night was the season premiere of the final season of “Dexter”, so I knew that today would be the perfect time to show you how to do:

**“Dexter” Blood Spatter Nails!**

Note: This tutorial was inspired by “Pretty Gossip” and their very helpful splatter nails tutorial found [here](http://prettygossip.com/2012/06/25/how-to-splatter-paint-nails/). :)

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base & top coat
- White nail polish
- Red nail polish
- Tape
- A straw (cut in half to make the force of the breaths more powerful)
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip paint on

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, buff, and style your nails in the manner you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Once the clear coat is dried, paint on 2-3 coats of the white polish to get a solid base color.

Step 4: Tape it! After your white polish has dried, take your tape and place small pieces around the edges of your nail. This will minimize cleanup when you do the “spatter”.

Step 5: Spatter time! Take your red polish and pour a small amount onto your piece of paper/plastic.

Dip your straw into the puddle, so that when you pull it back there is a thin film of red polish across the opening (like the film of soap when you blow bubbles). Position the straw over your fingernail, and blow a quick, sharp breath through the other end of the straw. This is your blood spatter! Depending on how much spatter you want on each nail, you can repeat this step a few times per nail.

Step 6: Remove it! Take off the tape when you finish the nail and see how much cleaner it looks. :)

Step 7: Finish it! Complete your spatter on all your nails, seal your manicure with a clear top coat, and clean up the edges.
