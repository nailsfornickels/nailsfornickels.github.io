Hello, lovely readers! Happy Monday!

So the heat of summer is back in full swing in Colorado. :P I tell you, I cannot WAIT for fall! It’s my favorite season, and I’ve had a MASSIVE craving for it lately ;) But while the summer heat is still with us, how about we do another fruity manicure with today’s tutorial:

**Watermelons!**

Step 1: Supplies! For this manicure, you will need:

- Clear base and top coat
- Nail polish in pink/red, green, and black
- A piece of paper/plastic to drip polish on
- A toothpick
- Hole reinforcement stickers

Step 2: Prep it! Clean, shape, and buff your nails in the style you prefer, then paint on the clear base coat.

Step 3: Paint it! Paint your nails with 2-3 coats of your red/pink polish, or however many coats it takes to get a solid color.

WAIT for the polish to dry completely before moving on to step 4. Your nails should be dry enough when you can rub them against each other without any tack.

Step 4: Sticker! Take one of the hole reinforcement stickers and place it over your nail, leaving the tip of your nail exposed.

Step 5: Paint & peel it! Paint the exposed tip of your nail with your green nail polish.

Step 6: “Seed” it! Take your black polish and drip a small amount onto your piece of paper/plastic.

Then, using the toothpick, paint small teardrop shaped “seeds” onto the pink part of your nail.

Step 7: Finish it! After the polish finishes drying, paint on your clear top coat, clean up the edges, and you’re done!
