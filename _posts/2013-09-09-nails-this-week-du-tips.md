Happy Monday, my lovely readers! How was your weekend? I hope it was fabulous :)

So guess what?? I START GRAD SCHOOL TODAY!! And oh MAN am I stupidly excited! ;)

Last week my program had their new student orientation, so to celebrate the occasion I did some fancy French tips: in my school colors of red and gold.

To create this look, I did the red tips using the rubber band method (which you can check out here) and and added two lines of gold striping tape directly underneath.

See you next time my lovelies <3
