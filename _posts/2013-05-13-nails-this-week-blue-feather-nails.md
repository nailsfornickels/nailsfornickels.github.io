Happy Monday my lovelies! Did you all have a fabulous weekend? This past week was WONDERFUL, I’ve been getting those half off frappuccinos at Starbucks all week *laughs*. But the promo ended yesterday and now I’m sad D: (Except I’m sure all of the baristas at Starbuck are ECSTATIC that the promo’s over, haha)

Anyhoo, I have a short post for you this week. I did those awesome “Feather Nails” with a gorgeous light blue polish I purchased last month. I really love the contrast between the lightness of the polish and the darkness of the feathers!

Protip: After doing this manicure style for a second time, I’ve found that the nails look best when you put them at an angle (so that the spine starts at the lower corner of your nail [by the cuticle], and the tip of the feather ends at the opposite upper corner)

Have a great week, dear readers! See you next time <3

**Nail polish used:**
