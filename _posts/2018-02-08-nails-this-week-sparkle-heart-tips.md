Happy Thursday, my lovelies! And happy 2018! It's been a minute since I made a post, huh?
The end of 2017 was very full: I got some awesome travel in and got to spend the holidays with family. I hope your end of the year was equally wonderful! :)

It's Valentine's Day on Wednesday! Do you guys have any plans for the holiday? I'm planning to spend the day with hubby and take in some gorgeous nature!

Most Valentine's nails are some combination of pink and/or red. But I like mixing things up, so I've gone with a subtle Valentine's theme this year. The base coat is white with a gradient of teal sparkles, sealed with a black French tip. The holiday detail is the final accent of a golden heart on each nail!

I really like this look! I think it stays in the theme of the holiday while also allowing you to play with atypical colors. Plus hey, you know me: I love anything with sparkle ;)

That's it for me, my lovelies! I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday in whatever capacity you're spending it. I'll see you next time! <3
