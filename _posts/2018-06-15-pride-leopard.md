Happy Friday, my lovelies! And happy Pride!

For those of you who don't know, June is Pride month, a time for people who fall in the LGBTQA spectrum to come together and celebrate who you are. Pride is celebrated to honor the Stonewall Riots of 1969, which were a tipping point for the "Gay Liberation Movement" in the United States. In the month of June, all across the country, cities and communities gather to celebrate and recognize LGBTQA people.

Obviously, there are a _lot_ of rainbow themed nails going around this time of the year, and as a pansexual woman I had to join in! I decided to do one of my favorite patterns with some rainbow colors: leopard print! I love doing leopard print nails because they always look SO cool and no matter what color scheme you choose, they're always going to pop. Something loud, colorful, and explosive sounded like a great design to me for this theme!

If you want to know how to do a leopard print, check out my tutorial [here.](/tutorial-leopard-print/) Like I said, it is CRAZY easy, and you don't need any special tools. Just grab yourself some toothpicks, whatever polish colors you want, and go nuts!
