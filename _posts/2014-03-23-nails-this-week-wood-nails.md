Happy Sunday, my lovelies!

I know what you’re thinking: “Whaaaaaat? A Nails for Nickels update on a Sunday, not a Monday??”

I know, it’s totally crazy, but I think we can get through this change together. ;) Starting next Monday I’ll be attending classes at my programming school and I know that I’ll be swamped. So I figured it would be best to start posting the weekly updates on Sunday mornings instead.

Anyhoo, like I was saying, happy Sunday! How’s the weekend going for you? It’s been gorgeous so far for me, so hubby’s and my day yesterday consisted of going grocery shopping, taking our puppy for walks in the gorgeous sunshine, and rewatching some Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. :) Gotta love those lazy weekends!

And speaking of lazy weekends, today’s manicure is pretty lazy in that it’s super simple! You need two brown nail polishes and that’s it. Awesome, right? Gotta love those simple manicures!

So today’s manicure features a new look for me: Wood Nails! Totally cool, right? I showed them to my husband and he had to touch them because he didn’t think they looked like my real nails. *laughs*

Today’s nails were created by following the amazing Chelsea King’s tutorial on her “Antique Nails”. Her technique is in the video [here](http://getnail-d.tumblr.com/post/29591162915/antique-nails-by-getnailedd), I just switched the colors to make a wooden-looking nails instead of antique metallic :) And if you haven’t heard of Chelsea King (I’m sorry, Chelsea QUEEN ;) ), then you need to check her out immediately!

To get this wooden effect on my nails, I first painted the nails with a light tan base color. I did the wood grain streaks using a darker brown, and then I sealed the manicure with a matte topcoat to give it a flat look instead of the normal lacquer-y shine.

Like I said, this manicure was super simple and a lot of fun to do! I have a couple of other ideas for this technique, and I can’t wait to try them out. That’s all for me today!

Have a great week, my lovelies! I’ll see you next time <3
